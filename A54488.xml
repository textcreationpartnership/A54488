            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE preſent thee One of the moſt Eminent pieces of Hiſtory in the whole World. The acuteneſſe of the Author in his manifold polite Writings is fully demonſtrated to all perſons in Chriſtendome. Inſomuch, that who hath not heard of his Fame, may be juſtly reputed to have ſpent his dayes in ſome Anchorite's Cell in the <hi>Terra incognita.</hi> Great and Exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite is the Learning, which he hath manifeſted in his Books of the <hi>Doctrine of the Times:</hi> though it muſt be confeſt, he is ſomewhat too liberal in his laſhing of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> a man of great Knowledge, yet too much doting upon his own parts. In this Diſcourſe he ſhews the conciſeneſſe of his pen without obſcurity. Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> and others that have highly deſerved by their Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Theatre of Hiſtory, have ſo voluminouſly inlarged themſelves, that the Reader's patience is too diſcourteouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. We muſt acknowledg much to the view of the four Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies exhibited by <hi>Sleidan;</hi> yet the curtneſſe of that Piece is ſuch, that many ſtately and heroick Actions of Noble Princes are either not toucht at all, or ſleightly paſt over, without ſatisfaction given to the diligent Inquirer. <hi>Cluverius</hi> hath written well, but not comparably to this Learned Man: having not ſo well ſtated the Chronological part of his Hiſtory. Whereas Here, beſides the innumerable teſtimonies of all the Ancient and Modern Authours, whoſe Writings are of any uſe and ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary help to ſo general and brave a Work; ye have likewiſe many of the moſt famous Eclipſes and Celeſtial Characters ſet down in their diſtinct places out of <hi>Herodotus, Thucydides, Ariſtotle, Plutarch,</hi> and hundreds of others in the Monkiſh Age, which are moſt infallible demonſtrations of the truth of thoſe paſſages and relations herein delivered. So that we may ſafely ſay, without the Cenſure of arrogance, That in reſpect of thoſe heavenly <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> whereby Hiſtory is made to ride in its moſt triumphant Chariot, there was never yet an Hiſtoricall Book ſo Compleat as this, Extant in any Age. He is not ſo ſhort, as to draw the vail of brevity over any Noble Actions: He is not ſo long and profuſe, as to Nauſeate the Reader with prolixe and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
<pb facs="tcp:33388:4"/>circumſtances: wherein others take too much liberty to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert their own private Judgments and deſcants upon the Warlike Actions and deliberated Counſels of great Kings and Generals, ſometimes impertinently, ſometimes abſurdly and childiſhly; whereas the matter of fact, a thing principally to be attended by ſober Hiſtorians, might be comprehended in a ſmall view. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that we may truly term this, <hi>The Index of Times;</hi> ſo that any perſon that is inquiſitive into more ample Narrations, may by his choice Citations furniſh himſelf with a whole Library of Hiſtory. In a word, he deſerves the Laurell from them all, a Temple of praiſe to be erected to his honour, and all other Hiſtorians to be offered up as Victims to his renown.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, We muſt acquaint thee (moſt Candid Reader) that where Our Noble Author does terminate his Account of the Hiſtory of former times; that the Work might be produced Compleat in all its parts, we have made uſe of various helps and obſervations of thoſe who have lived beyond the Seas, as well as at home, to draw the Diſcourſe down to this very day. We have indeed in the latter years more copiouſly inlarged, becauſe the great and general Wars of Chriſtendome, ſince the blazing of the great Comet in 1618, have adminiſtred more plentifull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both at home and abroad, then ſeveral Ages that have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, We have annexed a Compendious Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Diſcourſe of the whole Earrh, and its moſt memorable places, that ſo the beautifull Statue of Hiſtory might have both her eyes (<hi>Chronology</hi> and <hi>Geography</hi>) in a moſt lively manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted for the grand ornament of her perſonage. From whence the Hiſtorical paſſages in the foregoing Treatiſes may be fixed to the very places wherein they were acted by the Noble Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Armies, in their ſeveral Warlike Expeditions againſt their Enemies.</p>
            <p>Accept therefore this Tract as a moſt choice Treaſure: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou mayeſt be inriched with the knowledge of the rareſt and moſt material Tranſactions that have happened under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Divine Providence ever ſince the World began.</p>

This is, I ſay, a thing altogether Noble, and Honourable unto our Learning, that thou, a child of a Kingly ſtock, and towardneſse, doſt accuſtome thy ſelf in handling thoſe; not that thou calleſt forth the Maſters of them home unto thee, or receiveſt them in the room of a delight, and pleaſant Narration, but that thou thy ſelf of thine own accord commeſt daily to their houſes; neither in performing the Duties of Schollers, doſt take any thing proper to thy ſelf above others. Wherefore either of you both get unto your ſelves an everlaſting name, and fame; and alſo do give an example to this and the following Age, in what great eſteem henceforward they ought to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; That that may be plucked out of the opinion of men, which ſeemeth to have made many of that rank, either openly, or by a ſilent cuſtome and judgment, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:33388:5"/>Father; but in thee nothing leſse, and they truſt will be agreeable to theſe good things of Birth and Nature, which thou beareſt before thee. The which hope, conceived of thee by the opinion of all, thoſe ſo many tokens of excelling Vertues, which thou haſt even at that Age, do render confirmed, and ſure. I know not what altogether Divine thing there is in you Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a higher towardneſse then the common capacity, which ſeparateth you from the common ſort, and plainly ſheweth that ye were born unto the Rule of Men, and to take in hand great and difficult matters. And as in the Bee's kind, ſome ſigns are put on their Kings, whereby they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily known from the reſt. Or as the ſucceſsours of the <hi>Spartans</hi> were made remarkable by a Launce; The <hi>Polopidans</hi> by an Ivory ſhoulder; The <hi>Seleucidans</hi> by an Anchor, others by other naturall marks: So there is wont to be in Great men ſome excellent thing; whom the will of God, who governeth not ſo much the condition of a ſtock, as all things, and ſetting down to every one his own rank, lifteth up above the Lot of other men.</p>

            <p>That, being a Child, in this ſhadowy, and ſporting encounter, thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt a flouriſh with thoſe Triumphs, which afterward in a ripe Age thou ſhalt carry back from lawfull enemies, and battels. Unto theſe, which commonly ſeem more gorgeous, thoſe many better things happen; A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain flower of integrity, and comelineſse, beſmeared with the ſpots of no Vices, a teachable nature, and pliant and bending to the will of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioner, as alſo pure Manners, and lovely, and, toward all, even the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the greateſt gentleneſse, and courteſy of talk. Laſtly, a diligent lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Chriſtian Piety, and Worſhip, without guile. Theſe, and others of like ſort, great of themſelves, yet in thee they are but the ſeeds and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, with which thy mind waxeth by degrees ripe, and is perfected unto the grace beſeeming a Prince.</p>
            <p>But I have not determined here to make a ſolemn cry of thy praiſes. That, when there ſhall be need, the which I had begun to ſpeak of, it ſhall behoove all chiefly, who follow after Learning's Studies, to agree, and endeavour together for that end: and alſo above all, our Society ſhall need
<pb facs="tcp:33388:5"/>to do it: unto whoſe education, thy Father (never without praiſe to be named) hath paſsed thee over. The which when he did, he gave together therewith, a pledge and token of his ſingular eſteem and affection of it; and likewiſe he obliged Its faithfulneſſe towards thee, that by what means it could, it ſhould imploy it ſelf both for the enlarging thy renown, and alſo for helping, and ſtirring up thy ſtudies. I therefore, who, becauſe I am of that Fellowſhip, and a lover of liberall Arts, do think my ſelf held by the law of both duties, I judged that I muſt perform my duty in that very thing, by fathering this Work on thee: within which all Hiſtory from the beginning of the World unto the times of our Age, with as much brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and diligence as I could, I have contained. For ſo I thought I might chiefly profit thy ſtudies; whoſe chief part is placed in the knowledge of Hiſtory, and Antiquity. But Wiſe men rightly deliver, this to be not onely comely for Princes, but very profitable. Whether becauſe the civill learning of Prudence is taken out of that, while men learn from others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and chances, with no pains of theirs, and danger, what in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their own, or common affairs, is to be held, and avoided; or from ſo daily a changeableneſse of humane affairs, and fortune, which they gather from thence, and the downfall of Empires, and Cities, they are wont to make little regard of thoſe, and, both in defending them, or requiring them, to give a mean to their deſires; and paſſe over their purpoſes unto the fruit of ſound and conſtant glory, which by vertue and godlineſse alone is received. That this is even the moſt excellent uſe of reading Hiſtory, eſpecially that grave Author <hi>Otho</hi> of <hi>Friſingia,</hi> doth (not once) admoniſh, chiefly in theſe words, which he hath placed in the end of his ſecond Book. All theſe evills of things, nodding, or ſhaking (as I may ſo ſpeak), the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deaths of mortall men, ought to ſend us unto the true, and remaining life of eternity. Thou ſhalt gather out of this our book the ſame kind of fruit, of manners, and life, not onely more profitably, but alſo, which is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse of thy Wit, more pleaſantly, than that of ſcience, and knowledge, of which there is eſpecially a forcible love in Children. And hence, laſt of all, from thoſe two duties towards thee, which I have ſaid to be owing from me with the whole ſociety, there will be made another conſequent, that although there being as yet no private Deſerts of thine; of thy moſt illuſtrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſurely there is toward me, as alſo toward our Society, common to both, I will in like manner pay the Honour, and Obſervance due from me by this (what ſort ſoever) commendation of thy name.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IF Divine Authority could not perſwade us, that God did create the World, yet its contemplation would ſufficiently teach us the ſame: Although that great Artificer could in a moment of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33388:8"/>time create it whole and compleat in all its parts, yet was he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willing to perfect it by little and little, in the ſpace of ſix dayes.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore in the beginning of all things nothing did appear and exiſt beſides the earth,
<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> and that huge immenſity of waters that overſpreaded the Earth: Then the waters were not ſo thick joyned together, as we ſee them now, but thin, and like unto a vapour, and the miſt had filled up this whole <hi>vacuum</hi> or hollow place, which the vaſtneſſe of the celeſtial bodies, and of the other Elements did poſſeſſe upon the Earth. <hi>Moſes</hi> declareth them partly by the denomination of waters, and partly of the deep; which he ſaith to have been encompaſſed by darkneſſe, when he light was not yet brought forth, and that the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. Out of the Water and Earth, as out of their matter, were afterward all the other bodies formed, that are reckoned in the ſix dayes work. Now when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, That, <hi>In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth;</hi> it's a general ſentence that comprehends all that which was done in thoſe ſix dayes, which, afterwards is expounded throughout all its parts.</p>
                     <p>On the firſt day God created the Light, which the Water or that thin and immenſe Region of vapours did receive, the Sun not being yet produced; and that he might define and diſtinguiſh the ſpaces of the day and of the night, he encompaſſed this ſame Light with the motion and agitation of that miſty body.</p>
                     <p>On the ſecond day was the Firmament formed of God; by which appellation we believe are ſignified as well the celeſtial bodies, as the Ayr and Skye: that is, all that which appears from the Earth unto the extremities and farthermoſt parts of the World, which is vulgarly believed to be hollow and empty: for the forming of all which, the deep, that is, that huge and infinite lump of waters ſubtilified and attenuated into a vapour, did afford the matter: Again, the Firmament hath that power given unto it to divide the waters above, from the waters below: not that it ſelf whole ſhould in its middle come betwixt them both, but onely in one of its parts, which being the neareſt to the Earth, is called the lower Region of the Ayr; for as it is part of the Firmament that is of that outſtretched voidneſſe, ſo likewiſe it may be called Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament or ſpreading: the higher-moſt waters are clouds, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the midſt of the ayr, out of which rain is engendred, the lowermoſt are the Seas and the Rivers, which had their beginning the day following.</p>
                     <p>On the third day he firſt gathered the waters into one place, yea even into ſo many places as there are Seas and Rivers, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heaped the Mountains to an immenſity, and made hollow channels, he made them receptacles and paſſages of waters: thence he commanded the earth to be cloathed with the green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and verdure of the herbs and plants, and to bring forth Trees.</p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:33388:8"/>
                     <p>And God ſet the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars in the Firmament of the Heaven on the fourth day.</p>
                     <p>And on the fifth day God created the fiſhes and the fowls out of the water.</p>
                     <p>On the ſixth day he at laſt formed Man out of the earth, and breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life, and man became a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul, to whom he gave the name of <hi>Adam,</hi> from the Earth:
<note place="margin">The Earthly Paradiſe.</note> Then did God tranſport this new man into thoſe moſt pleaſant and delightfull Gardens which he had planted, which by a right apprehenfion were in the Land of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or in the Confines of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> and <hi>Meſopotamia:</hi> for <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth by name, have not their channels running in any other place. Now in this garden, amongſt all other Trees, for the uſe and delight of Man, God did plant two remarkable Trees, the one of life, and the other of Knowledge of Good and Evill; the former hath gotten its name from the effect,
<note place="margin">Auguſt. 3. civ. c. 20. Proſper. 2. de vita cont. c. 18. Auguſt. 14. civ. c. 17. par. 1. c. 19.</note> becauſe it had the vertue to lengthen health, and foment life, as <hi>Auguſtine, Proſper,</hi> and others do judge: the latter is ſo called from the event, becauſe that as ſoon as they had taſted of its fruit, they underſtood into what a great evill they had fallen, having loſt ſo great a good, as it ſeemeth to the ſame <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and alſo to <hi>Bar Cephe</hi> in his Commentary of Paradiſe;
<note place="margin">Rup. 2. de Trin. c. 27. Gen. 4. Gen. 4.14. Gen. 4.26. Gen. 5.22.</note> or becauſe the Serpent did promiſe from that Tree, the knowledge of good and evill, as <hi>Rupertus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it, very diſcreetly: There the Lord formed that ribb which he had taken out of the ſide of <hi>Adam</hi> when he was aſleep, into a woman, which he gave to him for his companion and help-meet: but ſhe brought upon her ſelf and him a more grievous ruine, then any cruel enemy; who, being inticed by her flatteries, did cat that fruit preſented by her to him of the forbidden Tree; the guilt of which wickedneſſe procured upon him a ſudden and preſent puniſhment, and a future upon his poſterity: Therefore being caſt out of that bleſſed Manſion, he with the companion of his fault is caſt out into the miſeries of this life. Then the firſt of men that were born of them, were <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> of whom the firſt excrciſed his life in the tilling of the ground,
<note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> and the other in the feeding of Cattel, who for his integrity and uprightneſſe was beſt accepted of God; And for this cauſe <hi>Cain</hi> burning with wrath and envy, murthered his innocent brother; and in revenge of this his murther, being a fugitive and vagabond on the Earth, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat children like to himſelf, namely rebels and enemies of God; and he built a City, and called it by the name of his ſon <hi>Enoch:</hi> But <hi>Seth,</hi> a while after <hi>Abel</hi>'s death, being born to <hi>Adam,</hi> begat a poſterity contrary to that, namely godly and religious; whoſe ſon <hi>Enos</hi> is ſaid to have began to call upon the Name of the Lord; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as the opinion is, he did publickly re-eſtabliſh that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, which had been blotted out by <hi>Cain's</hi> children; and amongſt the reſt came that excellent and renowned <hi>Enoch, Jared</hi>'s ſon: Whom God having loved for his innocency, he took up to himſelf alive from the eyes of men, having not yet fully ended
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33388:9"/>his dayes; whoſe poſterity, whom the Scripture calls, The ſons of God, being grown worſe, and degenerated from their good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, joyned themſelves in marriage with <hi>Cain</hi>'s poſterity, out of which mixture and commerce were Gyants brought forth. Then mortal men addicting themſelves to all ſorts of wickedneſſe, did turn and draw Gods wrath upon themſelves. When no cauſe of delay could be objected to him, all Vertue being extinguiſhed and blotted out from amongſt men: Then therefore God, angry and offended by <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity, decreed to deſtroy them all by an inundation of waters. There remained one onely of <hi>Seth</hi>'s bloud, who did perſiſt in the faith and obedience of God: to him doth God reveal the certainty of his counſel a hundred and twenty years before-hand;
<note place="margin">Noah's Ark.</note> and commands him to build an Ark for himſelf, in it to ſave few men and beaſts. This Patriarch employed a whole hundred years in the building of it,
<note place="margin">Gen. 7.2.</note> which was three hundred cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits in length, in breadth fifty, and in heighth thirty, having the firſt, ſecond, and third ſtories, in which he gave to every kind of living creatures their manſion; eight heads of men in all, of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clean beaſts and fowls by ſeven, and of unclean by two, were ſhut up in this Ship, and ſo raiſed up and taken away by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the deluge, all other things were deſtroyed by the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inundation of the waters over all the earth, which the continuall rain of fourty dayes, and the fountains of the great deep, being broken, had cauſed; ſo that the high Hills that were under the whole Heaven were covered by it, and the water prevailed fifteen cubits over them. And that was the year from the Creation of the World, 1656, and before Chriſts birth, 2329.</p>

                        <hi>Noah</hi> being come forth out of the Ark, offered burnt-offerings unto the Lord in the Mountains of <hi>Armenia;</hi> where ſome ancient Authors have recorded, That the remnants and pieces of this Ark were reſerved a very long time.</p>
                     <p>After this, <hi>Noah</hi> having applyed his mind to husbandry, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Vineyard, and having drunk ſomewhat largely of the Wine, whoſe virtue and ſtrength he did not yet know, became drunk, and then fell into a ſleep, whom undecently lying in his Tent, with his ſhame uncovered, <hi>Ham</hi> mocked, and ſhewed to his brethren; but they turning their backs and going backward, did caſt a cloke upon it: But their father afterwards knowing the thing, having
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33388:9"/>curſed <hi>Ham</hi>'s poſterity, did bleſſe <hi>Seth</hi>'s and <hi>Japhet</hi>'s children. Then Mankind being propagated by theſe three, did ſoon encreaſe ſo much, that one Countrey could not alone contain them any longer, and even the other parts of the World alſo were to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited. Into which before they went to ſojourn, and before they were ſeparated aſunder, they went about to build a high Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Land of <hi>Shinar,</hi> whoſe top might reach unto Heaven, that might be to them a name, and a general Monument to all their poſterity; for then the whole Earth was of one language, and of one ſpeech, and God did confound it, for to fruſtrate their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Imaginations, diſtracting it into ſeveral other tongues; ſo the commerce and underſtanding of the voice being taken away from them, they then left and caſt away their counſel and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of building; And what remained of this matter, is thought to have been for the beginning of <hi>Babylon;</hi> for that Tower began to be named <hi>Babel,</hi> from the mixture and confuſion of tongues.

                     <p>The ſame Author adds, That all the People beyond <hi>Iſthmus</hi> were in <hi>Greece,</hi> excepting the <hi>Athenians, Megarenſes,</hi> and <hi>Doricks,</hi> the Inhabitants of <hi>Parnaſsus,</hi> and were called <hi>Aeolians</hi> even to this time.

But the ſame Author in his 9th book writes, That <hi>Aepalius</hi> King of the <hi>Doricks</hi> being by <hi>Hercules</hi> reſtored to his Kingdom, for requital of that favour, adopted <hi>Hyllus, Hercules</hi>'s ſon, whom alſo he left his ſucceſſor: from whence ſprang the <hi>Heraclides,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiters of <hi>Peloponneſus.</hi> Moreover,<note n="†" place="margin">Strabo lib. 8.</note> the <hi>Ionians</hi> (as * <hi>Strabo</hi> writes) were by the <hi>Achaians,</hi> of the <hi>Aeolian</hi>'s ſtock, driven out of <hi>Agialus,</hi> or <hi>Achaia;</hi> from whence there remained but two ſorts in <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus,</hi> the <hi>Doricks,</hi> and <hi>Aeolicks.</hi>

                     <p>It is not in the power of humane Art exactly to compute the times wherein theſe things happened, yet I ſhall endeavour it in a homely ſtyle. <hi>Xuthus</hi> baniſht out of <hi>Theſsaly</hi> into <hi>Attica,</hi> repairs to King <hi>Erectheus; Erectheus</hi> began to raign in the year before Chriſt 1400, <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s flood is reported to be much about the year before Chriſt, 1529. So that the ſtock of <hi>Hellen</hi> being named <hi>Grecians,</hi> and diſtinguiſhed into ſeveral kinds of people, were about 14. or 15. ages before Chriſt. Much about the time that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> poſſeſt of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> began to be under Judges.

                     </head>
                     <p>THere is made frequent mention in ſacred books, of the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian</hi> Kings; even after that time, wherein <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> being dead, it is manifeſt that Empire, firſt begun by <hi>Belus</hi> or <hi>Ninus,</hi> had an end. For it is agreed amongſt all, that that happened in that year, wherein the foundations of the royall government of the <hi>Medes</hi> were laid, the which indeed we have ſhewn above in the 4th chapter, to have happened an hundred years before the firſt Olympiade, that is, three hundred and ſeventeen years before the beginning of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> But long after that time, other Princes of the <hi>Aſsyrians</hi> are reckoned up. So <hi>Azariah</hi> reigning after his nine and thirtieth year; <hi>Phul</hi> King of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> is ſaid to have
<note n="(b)" place="margin">4 Kings ch. 15.19.</note> vexed the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Which year is numbred ſeven hundred ſeventy one years before Chriſt, and is the hundreth and ſixth year from the death of <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> and the deſtruction of <hi>Nineveh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That I may not ſtay thee longer; I think that after that old Empire of the <hi>Aſsyrians</hi> put out,
<note place="margin">Jul.

Wherefore <hi>Nineveh</hi> being overthrown, and the former <hi>Aſsyrian</hi> Kings being taken away, there were afterwards new Kings, who reſtored that City, and bare a large rule, untill they were overcome in war by the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kings. The names of theſe, and what Kings were reigning in <hi>Judea,</hi> which indeed are mentioned in Scripture, I will write down.</p>

The fourteenth year of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> from theſe things which have been above explained, runneth into the year before Chriſt, 714. which is the thirty fourth from the beginning of <hi>Nabonaſsar.</hi> There is an old rule or Canon of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> kings, which <hi>Ptolemy</hi> and other Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians have uſed, which is lengthened from <hi>Nabonaſsar</hi> unto the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great.

                     <p>Wherefore there is a probable gueſſe, that ſome ſpace of time after the <hi>Aſsyrians,</hi> the <hi>Babylonians</hi> fell off from the <hi>Medes,</hi> and appointed themſelves a private kingdome, <hi>Nabonaſsar</hi> being their Captain.

Therefore when <hi>Sennacherib</hi> king of the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Aſsyrians</hi> had with great Forces aſſaulted <hi>Egypt, Sethon</hi> being forſaken by his Army, implored the ayd of his god; from whom a multitude of field Mice being ſent by night, gnawed aſunder their quivers of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and ſtrings of their bowes, and rains of their bucklers. So the day after the enemies being naked of weapons fled. There is no doubt, but that <hi>Sennacherib</hi> was the ſame King of <hi>Aſsyrians,</hi> who, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> reigning, ſacked <hi>Judea.</hi> For times on both ſides do agree.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Sethon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Twelve Princes.</note> twelve <hi>Aegyptian</hi> kings were chief over them, the Countrey being divided into ſo many parts. One of theſe was <hi>Pſammeticus;</hi> who being driven out by his fellows, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into marſhy places, by the help of the <hi>Ionians</hi> and <hi>Carians;</hi> the other eleven being overcome, he poſſeſſed all Egypt; and made friendſhip with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and he firſt gave them a field or Land in Egypt to inhabit in.

He brake a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den baſon, in which he had wont to waſh his feet with his gueſts, and made out of it the Image of a God, and dedicated it openly.

This man joyned onely one daughter which he had, (ſeeing he wanted manly off-ſpring), <hi>Mandanes,</hi> with a certain <hi>Perſian, Cambyſes,</hi> a quiet man, nor deſirous of new affairs, becauſe he had learned by a dream, that he ſhould be deprived of his Kingdome by a Nephew.

                        <hi>ANtoninus Pius,</hi> adopted by <hi>Hadrian,</hi> governed the Roman Empire in the year of Chriſt 138,
<note place="margin">Capitolinus Victor. Eutrop. 8.</note> with ſo much virtue and goodneſſe, that he excelled all other examples. For he governed the Common-wealth rather by a fatherly, then Princely affection; and he governed the whole World by his ſole authority, without any war, all the time of his Empire: therefore was he compared with <hi>Numa.</hi> The Forrain and far diſtant Princes and people did ſo dread him, that they would make him the Arbitrator of their differences, he forbid enquiry to be made after them that had conſpired againſt him. He dieth in the year of his age 70, and of his Empire twenty four, <hi>Victor</hi> gives him up ſeventy two years, he died in the hundred ſixty one year after Chriſts Nativity, in the Moneth of March having taken the Scepter, the fifth of July, in the one hundred thirty eighth year of Chriſt; ſo that he Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the Empire two and twenty years, and almoſt eight Moneths.</p>
                     <p>After him, ruled the Empire <hi>M.

The publick trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure being ſpent, and exhauſted, leſt he ſhould burthen any one by taxes, he ſold and pawned all the plates, ornaments and Jewells that belonged to his imperiall Majeſty, and after his victory he repayed the price back again to them that had bought them, and were willing to render them back: <hi>Avidius Caſsius</hi> upon a falſe report of his death took the Government upon himſelf,

                        <hi>Helvius Pertinax</hi> was made Emperour by them who had deſtroyed <hi>Commodus:</hi> who when he intended to govern the Common-wealth with good Lawes, and to cruſh the military ambition and rudeneſſe, was cut off the 88th day of his Empire, at whoſe death <hi>Didius Julianus</hi> did preſume to aſpire to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Empire, then floating and tottering.

                     <p>For this man being born in <hi>Africk,</hi> and Governour of <hi>Pannonia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Spart. &amp; alii ſuperiores.</note> through a ſhew of avenging <hi>Pertinax,</hi> he violently took the Empire upon himſelf. And firſt he diſcharged the Pretorian bauds cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented by his own ſervants for murthering <hi>Pertinax</hi> unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily; then he went againſt <hi>Peſcennius Niger</hi> Governour of <hi>Syria;</hi> and <hi>Clodius Albinus</hi> Governour of <hi>Brittain,</hi> and both competitors of the Empire. <hi>Niger</hi> being the firſt overcome, (<hi>Antioch,</hi> where he had fled, being taken) flying to <hi>Euphrates,</hi> was killed, as ſaith <hi>Herodianus.

                     <p>Having quieted all things in the Eaſt, he turned his arms againſt <hi>Clodius Albinus,</hi> whoſe friendſhip hitherto he had procured to himſelf, by offering him the dignity of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> encountring him with his Army near <hi>Lions</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>

                     <p>Thence again being gone into the Eaſt, he ſubdued the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the <hi>Adiabenians</hi> and the <hi>Arabians,</hi> he granted a Charter of Corporation to the <hi>Alexandrians.

                        <note place="margin">Spart.</note> and their wedding was ſolemnized about the tenth year of <hi>Severus</hi>'s Empire, and ſhe had as much for her portion, as would have been a ſufficient dowry for fifty Queens. But not long after, near upon the 204th year of Chriſt, <hi>Plautianus</hi> himſelf conſpiring againſt the General, is ſlain by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus</hi> his ſon in law, and many more were put to death after him, who were his Confederates in the Conſpiracy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Severus</hi> went to <hi>Britain</hi> in the 15th year of his Empire, with his two ſons; <hi>Baſianus,</hi> whom he ſirnamed <hi>Antoninus,</hi> and had made <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in the ſeventh year of his Empire; and with <hi>Geta:</hi> There, having had a proſperous ſucceſs of his affairs for four years ſpace, he retired himſelf, and fortified it with a wall all round about the Iſland, and there at length he dyeth at <hi>York</hi> the ninth of <hi>February,</hi> in the year of Chriſt 211, his eldeſt ſon having often plotted againſt him; after he had governed the Empire 17 years, eight moneths,
<note place="margin">Xiph.</note> and three dayes. At his death he left in ſtore ſeven years revenues and proviſions; ſo that every day might be ſpent ſeventy five thouſand buſhels of corn, and of oyl as much as might ſuffice all <hi>Italy</hi> in five years.</p>

After this <hi>Antoninus</hi> went into the Eaſt, and there he made a great ſlaughter of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Citizens, becauſe they had once ſpoken ſome words againſt him, he deceitfully invaded <hi>Artabanus</hi> King of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and ſpoyled his Kingdom, at length, ſix years and two

He was the vileſt of all men, inſomuch, that having caſt off all manhood, he difformed himſelf into a woman, and did ſuffer any thing in his body. Therefore having ruled three years and nine moneths, by the conſent of the Souldiers, he was ſlain with his Mother <hi>Semiamira</hi> or <hi>Julia,</hi> in the 222 year of Chriſt, his corps being dragg'd in the channel, and thence drawn into the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> in the 18th year of his age.

                     </p>
                     <p>In the year of Chriſt 222, <hi>Aurelius Severus Alexander</hi> obtained the Empire, having been made <hi>Caeſar</hi> the year before. A Prince far ſurpaſſing all in goodneſſe; and moſt excellent and valiant, both in peace and war. He was wonderfully diligent either in giving judgment, or in requiring juſtice of the Judges, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and corrected thoſe who by favour or bribes did exceed the bonds of Juſtice and right; he baniſhed out of his Court all flatterers, ſcoffers, and ſhames of the Court. He forbad the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Offices to be bought, aſſerting, That it could not be, but what one had bought, he would ſell it again for hire-ſake: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did give a Salary out of the Treaſury to the Governours of the Provinces, leſt they ſhould be burthenſome to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>He was not an enemy to Chriſt; for he worſhipped him in his Chappel, not being ſuffered by the Senate to give him any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick divine honour, and to build him a Temple: In miniſtring Juſtice, he made uſe of the induſtry of the chiefeſt and ableſt Lawyers, as

Againſt whom, making incurſion upon the Roman Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, when <hi>Alexander</hi> could not affright him away by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he went out with an Army, and overcame him; as <hi>Lampri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> records out of the Acts of the Senate; and triumphed the 7th of October.

Whence in his hunting as often as he lighted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Boor, he was wont to kill him with his own hands with a hunting ſtaffe, but after he had ſlain <hi>Aper,</hi> then he boaſted that at length he had found out the fatall Bore: Then the Peaſants of France riſing up in an uproar that were called <hi>Bacaudes,</hi> having ſent <hi>Maximian Herculian</hi> to them, he quieted them in the 285 year, whereupon <hi>Maximian</hi> was made <hi>Caeſar</hi> the firſt time: For the next year following being the 286 year. <hi>Diocleſian</hi> created him <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> becauſe, ſaith <hi>Idatius,</hi> he might prop up and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the republick that was tottering and falling, what by the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians incurſions, what by the Tyrants oppreſſions. For at the ſame time <hi>Carauſius</hi> being buſied among the Britains, and <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus</hi> in Aegypt, had both taken the purple Robe. And from the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:33388:106"/>Eaſt <hi>Narſes,</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> threatened hard with a puiſſant Army; and <hi>Africa</hi> was ſpoyled, and deſtroyed by the <hi>Quinqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentians.</hi> By which troubles and tempeſts was the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire toſſed and agitated ſome years together.

                     <p>A New Family of Kings after the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the third,
<note place="margin">Annals of France.</note> fortunately began in the year 1589, <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th King of Navarr being taken to the Rule of the French; againſt whom the covenanted-Princes, becauſe he was not as yet a Catholike, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed war. The Captain of theſe was <hi>Charls</hi> of Medua, the brother of <hi>Henry</hi> of Guiſe, ſlain by <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d. A little after, a diſturbance of things followed through all France. When as parties ſtriving with a killing hatred, and the agreement of Cities being rent aſunder; as well the neighbouring Cities among themſelves, as all people of the ſame Cities among each other, burned with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſcords. <hi>Charls Borbon,</hi> the Kings Uncle, who was as yet kept in cuſtody, is ſaluted by a mock, the tenth King of that name, in the year 1590.
<note place="margin">The Juriacan Fight.</note> Between theſe things, a noble victory being gotten at the Temple of <hi>Andrew,</hi> through which the Earl of Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monda, a Leader of the Spaniſhayds, dyed; and which is wont to be called the <hi>Juriacan</hi>-battel. <hi>Henry</hi> compaſſeth Paris with a moſt ſtraight ſiege, when in the mean time, <hi>Charls Borbon</hi> paid his debt to Nature at Fontenaium: and the Duke of Parma coming out of Belgium to bring help to the Pariſians, the King, the City being left, leadeth an Army againſt him, and maketh proviſion to fight. But at Paris, after the looſing of the ſiege, aſſemblies are ſolemnized by the covenanted-Princes in the year 1593, for the chooſing a new King. But thoſe were made voyd by the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and diſagreement of the Princes.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th embraced the Catholique Faith.</note> 
                        <hi>Henry</hi> having profeſſed the Catholique faith, July 25, ſent the Duke of <hi>Niverna</hi> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour to Rome, unto <hi>Clement</hi> chief Biſhop, (who the former year had entred the Prelateſhip, Jan. 30,) to requeſt pardon. The which when the Biſhop deferred, <hi>Henry</hi> in the mean time is anointed at Autricum of the Carnutians, with holy oyl, Febr. 27, in the year 1594; becauſe Durocottorum of Rhemes, where that thing according to the cuſtome was wont to be performed, was in the power of the enemies. And then he is privily let into Paris, March 22, with armed Souldiers. At length, in the year 1595, the Biſhop being intreated by <hi>James Perron</hi> the King's Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, the ſentence of condemnation being aboliſhed, he wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the king. In which thing, <hi>Francis Tolett</hi> Cardinal of the Jeſuites Society, performed a famous work for him, although by birth a Spaniard; and the king held himſelf to owe much unto him before thoſe of that Nation. But then, the Governour and Cities returned, ſtrivingly, unto the defence of <hi>Henry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At length, in the year 1598, at Vervin, May the 2d, a peace
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:33388:213"/>was eſtabliſhed between the French and Spaniards, the chief Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop being the author: and <hi>Philip</hi> of Spain the fifth moneth from thence, dyed the 13th of September.</p>

Therefore through the abſence of the Duke of Parma, who ever and anon ran out againſt <hi>Henry</hi> into France; he took ſome Cities by force and ſurrender. The Parmian Duke dyed at Atrebates, in the year 1592, in whoſe place firſt of all <hi>Erneſt</hi> of Auſtria, the brother of <hi>Rodulph</hi> the Emperour, was: Then he being dead, <hi>Albert</hi> a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, the brother of them both was ſent; unto whom <hi>Iſabel,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Philip</hi> the elder, being given in wedlock, the dominion of thoſe Provinces chanced by lot in the year 1598.

<note n="(b)" place="margin">Annals of France.</note> In the mean time, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of England in the year of her age 70, the 45 of her reign yielded to Nature's deſtiny, of Chriſt 1602, and had <hi>James</hi> king of Scotland her Succeſſour, (the which thing ſhe had commanded by Will) born of <hi>Mary Stuart;</hi> whom I have mentioned above to have been ſlain by <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> againſt right.
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Spond. Chron. <hi>The Kingdom of Swethland uſurped by</hi> Charls.</note> Alſo in <hi>Swethland</hi> there was trouble: When as <hi>Charls</hi> the Uncle of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> king of Poland had craftily taken away the kingdom committed to his truſt, <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> being excluded; who therefore had contended out of Poland, that he might recover it, in the year 1599. That being taken away from the Catholique Prince, afterward the Proteſtant Governours paſſed it over by a publique decree, on <hi>Charls</hi> partaker of the ſame ſect, in the year 1604. Furthermore, that <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the onely ſon of <hi>John</hi> the third, king of Swethland, who dyed in the year 1592, in the ſame year was called King of the Swedes, the affairs of Swethland be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought into good order, two years after he had returned into Poland. In Hungary and Tranſylvania there were the like ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings for Religion's ſake.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sigiſmund Bathor</hi> Prince of Tranſylvania, uſing raſh Counſel, in the year 1598 had departed from his dominion for the ſake of <hi>Maximilian</hi> of Auſtria; <hi>Andrew Bathor</hi> the Cardinal, his father's brother's ſon bare that thing grievouſly; and a little after <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> himſelf changing his mind, brake his covenants. Thereby a War began to be waged between the Bathorians and Auſtrians; Tranſylvania remained in the power of theſe: <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> by the interpoſing of <hi>Clement</hi> chief Biſhop, returned into favour with the Emperour; and at length dyed at Prague in the year 1613. But the Proteſtants again, the Emperour being deſpiſed, chooſe <hi>Botſicaius</hi> a Hungarian, beſmeared with the errours of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> their Captain or Duke; who by the help of the Turks joyned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him a great part of <hi>Dacia,</hi> and miſerably vexed the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques;
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:33388:214"/>in the year 1605. The ſame man the following year ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth peace with the Emperour on theſe conditions, That for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and children, if he ſhould leave any males, he ſhould have Tranſylvania: At which time <hi>Rodulph</hi> the Emperour entred into a twenty years truce with the Turks. But in <hi>Moſcovy</hi> the ſame year 1606, <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Prince, becauſe he was of a more inclinable mind toward the Germans and Polonians, neither diſagreed from the Biſhop of Rome, by his own Subjects is moſt cruelly ſlain.</p>
                     <p>That I may bring back my Pen unto the Affairs on this ſide Rhene, <hi>Henry</hi> King of France proclaimed war againſt <hi>Charls</hi> Duke of the Allobrogians, in the year 1600, that he might retake the dominion of Saluſſia, poſſeſſed by him through the Civil Troubles of France. At laſt they agree between themſelves; and the Countrey of Saluſſia was repayed with the Province of the Sebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians on this ſide the Alps. Two years after <hi>Charls Gontald</hi> Duke of Bironia, being hitherto, for his warlike boldneſſe, and undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courage in dangers, very acceptable unto <hi>Henry,</hi> when as he deſired greater matters, and privily conſpired againſt the King's life, was beheaded the day before the Kalends of Auguſt, in the year 1602.</p>
                     <p>The Jeſuit-Society being nine years before by the decree of the Senate,
<note place="margin">The Jeſuite-Society re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</note> commanded to depart from Paris, and other Cities, is cal'd back again by the kings Proclamation, the year 1603 going out. Which Proclamation, the Senate of Paris, the 4th Nones of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, of the year following had confirmed. The ſame fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip being much deſired by many Cities of the kingdome, through the moſt greateſt will of the moſt courteous King, began to open or prepare Schools in many places.</p>
                     <p>Of deſiring which, the King himſelf gave an example unto the people: Who likewiſe at his own charge appointed Schools for that fellowſhip at Flexia of the Andegavians; the Palace of the Vindocinian Dukes being ordained for them: in which firſt the Seminary was brought; and with a decree, that after death his heart ſhould be ſafely laid up there. Which thing indeed being ſooner done, than was profitable for the kingdom and ſociety, both grieved. My mind is agaſt to relate the moſt bitter death of the moſt valiant, and moſt courteous king after this incloſed domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Whom when all deſired to be immortal, the parricide of one deteſtable privy murtherer took away, May the 14th, of the year 1610, the day after that he had taken care for <hi>Mary</hi> his wife to be anointed and crowned (as the manner of Queens is) at the Town of <hi>Dionyſius.</hi> She was the daughter of <hi>Francis Medices</hi> the great Duke of Etruria; who in the year 1600, a marriage being entred into with <hi>Henry,</hi> brought forth the year following 1601, <hi>Ludovick,</hi> a Prince profitable unto France, Sept. 27.</p>
                     <p>While <hi>Henry</hi> reigned over France; what with holineſſe, what with learning adorned, famouſly dyed, <hi>Philip Nerius</hi> a teacher of Latine Oratory, in the year 1595, March 26, who by <hi>Gregory</hi> the 14th, with four others, <hi>Iſidore</hi> a Spaniard; <hi>Ignatius,</hi> builder of the

Some of the chief ones made a beginning of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multing in the year 1614; who hated the too much power of the Florentine <hi>Concinus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Between theſe ſtirs, <hi>Lewis</hi> went into Aquitane in the year 1616, that he might take <hi>Anne,</hi> the daughter of the Catholique King, <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, (whom he before, by an Embaſſadour, had eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to himſelf,) unto a lawful wedlock: and at the ſame time with the like good ſucceſſe, he took his ſiſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to be joyned with <hi>Philip</hi> the ſon of <hi>Philip</hi> the third. So two moſt mighty Princes, with the greateſt profit unto Chriſtian affairs, more ſtrictly bound the promiſe of peace between themſelves by this nuptial exchange.

                     <p>The Princes,
<note place="margin">Now ſtrius.</note> who the former year had made a fellowſhip with him, depart from the Court.

                     <p>The Queen-Mother, untill theſe Troubles were appeaſed, being in the mean time intreated to go apart, betook her ſelf to Bleſa. From which time King <hi>Lewis</hi> began to carry on the Common-wealth by his own authority. The beginning of which to be managed, that he might take from Religion, in the moneth September, he by a publique Law decreed, That in the Province of <hi>Benearn,</hi> which is ſituate at the Pyrenaean bottoms, the Catholique worſhip ſhould be every where reſtored; and alſo that the Proteſtants ſhould reſtore the goods taken away about 50 years before, unto the Churches.</p>

                     <p>Which was the ſixth from a new company of Clerks framed at the ſame <hi>Lutetia</hi> or <hi>Paris,</hi> under the name of the Oratory. which being gathered together by <hi>Peter Berull</hi> a Pariſian Elder, in the year 1612. <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth, the year following, by an Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall

Moreover <hi>Urbane</hi> the eighth regiſtred the author of this famous inſtruction, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the like praiſe of learning and Godlineſſe, into the order of the moſt eminent Cardinalls in the year 1627. Who, two years after being increaſed with great deſerts, and famous in a great off ſpring, died the ſixth Nones of October in the year 1629. of his age the 55th.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time,
<note place="margin">The War in the Tellinian Valley.</note> in which it was warred the Palatinate, (that was the year 1620) in the Valley of Telline: which at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Rhetians</hi> or <hi>Canes,</hi> whom they call the <hi>Griſons;</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill troubles flamed. The Catholiques being provoked with the injuries of the Proteſtants, hidden Counſells being entred into among themſelves, oppreſſe or come upon all the Calviniſts: and the aid of Duke <hi>Ferias</hi> Governour of Mediolum being intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they get leave of him of enjoying Caſtles in ſome fit places. Moreover the Rhetian Nation being all troubled, and with them the Venetians: who believed theſe incloſures of Italy to be held by a continuall poſſeſſion by the Spaniards, was in no caſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for their affairs, both defiring aid from him. <hi>Ludovick</hi> King of France was not wanting, and firſt of all, in the year 1620, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Embaſſadours from the King of Spain, that he ſhould promiſe to reſtore all things wholly, while they conſulted of the Catholique affairs. Which caution being approved by the moſt Chriſtian King, when as nevertheleſſe the matter wanted an iſſue, it is brought to weapons. Furthormore thoſe exerciſd the French and Spaniards, and the confederates of both, with a diverſe ſucceſs, for ſome years.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time a Civill war was renewed throughout <hi>France,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A Civill War in France.</note> ſome Governours conſpiring againſt <hi>Lewine,</hi> whoſe power had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed even unto envy; whom the ſecret flight of the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and her paſſage into the Caſtle of Andegavia, had enforced to attempt new matters.</p>
                     <p>In which war, <hi>Ludovick</hi> making uſe of the Faithfull endeavour and counſell of <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of Condy, who in the year one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred and nineteen, in the Moneth of October, had been freed from Priſon, in a ſhort time he reſtored reſt and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the French, in one fight at <hi>Caeſars</hi> bridge, the Armies of the adverſaries being ſlain. Which conqueſt made the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and others of thoſe parties, friends with the King in the year 1620.</p>

For the ſtubborn enemies being affrighted at the ſudden comming, the King found there all things inclinable to obedience.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, holy houſes, and the goods of the Catholiques were delivered into his power, that whole countrey lying under the Pyrenaean Hills, whoſe right it was to be ſeparated from the reſt of the Kingdome, from that time foreward he determined by
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:33388:216"/>his decree that it ſhould be made tributary to the ſame, the which at laſt in the year 1624, was eſtabliſhed. But three years before, of Chriſt 1621, very many Towns of the Santons, and Novempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulonia, and the neighbour Provinces, which are to the number of ſixty; were by force or fear, with a very great ſlaughter of the ſtubborn enemies, ſubdued.
<note place="margin">The ſiege of Mount Albane</note> By little and little the courſe of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries came on, to Mount Albane.

                     <p>About the ſame time alſo Breda a Town of Brabant,

With the Rebellious French it was fought by land, and Sea, and the ſame being every where overcome: but in this latter, in which <hi>Gauiſius</hi> was Captain, the Navy of the Rochella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Robbers being tamed, the Iſland Rhee was reduced into the power of <hi>Ludovick</hi> the King.</p>

But <hi>Mansfield</hi> had troubled Germany with often inroads and robberies, a tumultuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:33388:217"/>of robbers being gathered together. Who being put to flight by <hi>Tilly</hi> a moſt valiant commander, he fleeth unto <hi>Gabor</hi> the Tranſilvanian; and from thence ſtriving to go to the Venetians, with an incredible profit and joy of the Catholique parties, he periſhed, in the year 1626. The Rochellers unmindfull of their ſworn faith a little before, and of peace the ſame year received, call forth privily the Engliſh againſt the King. Who in the year 1627. being brought unto the Iſle Rhea, or of Rhee, with a Navy of an hundred and twenty Ships, <hi>Buckingham</hi> being Captain, they poſſeſſe the whole, except the Caſtle; over which <hi>Toiraſe</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, a ſtout man, and greatly skillful in warlike affairs. This man, although the works were new, nor as yet finiſhed, ſhifted off the ſharp and continuall forces of the enemies, untill now labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the want of all things, and being wearied, the induſtry of <hi>Ludovick</hi> the King came to help them. For this King uſing <hi>Ricelieu</hi> the Cardinall,
<note place="margin">The Iſle of Ree taken away from the Engliſh.</note> a man flouriſhing in all praiſe, his helper and Miniſter; he ſent over quickly <hi>Schonberg</hi> a famous Captain, indeed with no great number of ſouldiers unto the ſuccour of the beſieged; who, <hi>Toiraſe</hi> being joyned to him, drave out the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, being ſlain and chaſed out of all the Iſland.</p>
                     <p>Nothing ſeemed to be done by ſo many wars and Victories, as long as that deſpiſer Rochell,
<note place="margin">The ſiege of Rochell.</note> impatient of Kings, and all Rule, lifted up another Kingdome as it were in the middle of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Which City being ſcituate at the chinks, or overflowed places of the Ocean, it was fenced both with the nature of the place, and alſo with the hand, and Art, that it was commonly accounted invincible. This moſt ſure City, <hi>Ludovick</hi> attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with a great courage and hope, which he had taken from the help of God, being made triall of in ſo many affairs, in the year 1627. And the ſame <hi>Ricelieu</hi> the Cardinall, being partaker of the Counſells, by works and Fortifications, and, among other things, huge Bulwarks unmoveable, being finiſhed by the Ocean ſide, he ſo held it ſhut up a whole year, that the Citizens being killed up with hunger, and having ſuffered all extremity, yielded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the King. Therefore it, the walls being caſt to the ground, was reduced almoſt into the form of a Village for a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and example to others, that the invincible might rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the defence and clemency of their Prince, then to attempt weapons. Rochell was taken in the eight and twentieth year of that age, October the 30th. After that, the Rebels returned wholly unto their duty, neither ſaw the year following, any thing of an enemy left in France.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ludovick</hi> being buſied about Rochell, and the Engliſh: the Duke of Subaudia had ſtirred up the weapons of the Spaniards againſt <hi>Mantuan:</hi> with whom he had an old ſtrife about the poſſeſſion of Mountferrat. And alſo ſome Cities being already taken:
<note place="margin">The beſieging of Caſall.</note> and <hi>Caſal</hi> (that is, a Town, as leaſt antient, ſo of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, as the report is, the moſt fortified of all Italy) <hi>Collal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> had beſieged. <hi>Ludovick,</hi> things being appeaſed in Italy, led
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:33388:217"/>his Army, being Conquerour, thither thorow the Alps, and the cloſe places of the Mountains, being broken thorow, which alſo nature through the roughneſſe of places, and moſt ſtrong Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the enemy had made unpaſſible, he overcame Seguſio, a City under the Alps, at the firſt onſet, the three and twentieth of March, in the year 1629. The Spaniards having departed from Caſſal, left it free for a military ſupply, and Proviſions, our ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers carrying on their Journey within the Town. After the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the French, they by and by returned unto the ſiege that was broken off for a time, with a greater proviſion then before.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time, <hi>Collaltus</hi> Captain of the Emperours Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, very much waſted the land of Mantua: and <hi>Spinola</hi> chief Governour for the Spaniards from the Catholique king, a man of great fame for warfare, beſieged Caſall with all his Forces. But the unconquered vertue of <hi>Toiraſe,</hi> who held that Town in Garriſon, made all their endeavours void. At laſt, the French flee to <hi>Ricelieu</hi> the Cardinall, ordering the Warre with the greateſt power, the ſecond time beyond the Alps to bring help.</p>
                     <p>There, many Towns being conquered, while they extend their journey, ſtopped with many difficulties; Mantua, through the Plague received within the walls by the Townſ-men, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, being waſted, is ſuddenly invaded by the Germans, on the Moneth of July, in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and thirty.</p>
                     <p>The French being nothing affrighted with the miſery of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, three Armies being in vain oppoſed, the victories repeated over the enemies, they through valour brought forth thither a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for themſelves whither they had intended. Then under the very ſight of Caſal, and the Spaniard pitching his Tents, when they were in readineſſe to joyn battel, <hi>Mazarine</hi> running between, the matter is brought unto conditions of peace without arms, and bloud; by the higheſt providence toward both, yea toward all Chriſtians: leſt either through a great ſlaughter, victory ſhould be manifeſt to either; or might yield to neither, a mutuall ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being made. This was the end of the Italian Expedition, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember going out, of the year 1630. When as now the labour of the ſiege bringing a continued diſeaſe, a diſeaſe brought a departure of life to <hi>Spinola.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After theſe things the name of <hi>Lewis</hi> was famous throughout all people; not more by the report of weapons, than equity, and faithfulneſſe toward his fellowes, whoſe ſafety he held more belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, than his own private profits and wealth. Alſo the excell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force and vertue of mind of the moſt eminent Cardinal <hi>Rice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liou</hi> was for admiration; and in managing great affairs, a like induſtry of a diligent Wit.</p>

                     <p>In the year 1631, in the moneth of April, both Embaſſadours agreeing, a peace was eſtabliſhed between the Emperour and Duke of Mantua, on equal terms; and alſo the poſſeſſion of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua was confirmed to this man by the Emperour's decree, and of Montferrat, the ſecond day of July. Thus all things being appeaſed, the ancient reſt and quietneſſe returned unto Italy.</p>
                     <p>French and German ſtirrs followed Italian peace.
<note place="margin">The Offence of the Queen-Mother and King's Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> In France, the Queen-Mother, a grudge being taken up againſt Cardinal <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celieu,</hi> ſhe openly renounced her friendſhip from him; neither that ſhe might receive him into favour, could ſhe be intreated by any of his, or even by the intreaties of King <hi>Lewis</hi> her ſon himſelf. <hi>Gaſto</hi> the King's brother in a ſhort time after followed his Mother's example, and his mind being eſtranged from the ſame Cardinal, he departed unto Orleance, which City belonged to his Title.

Therefore on the very Kalends of September, of the year 1632, they met in a very ſhort, but bloudy battel at Caſtlenaudar; in which, the Rebells were overcome, and not a few chief men were ſlain. <hi>Montemorence,</hi> ſome wounds being received, came under the power of his enemies; and being brought to Tolouſe, a Sentence of his head being paſſed on him by the Senate, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his neck to the ſword or hatchet the third Kal.

And Craze being more than ordinarily diſpleaſed with <hi>Fridland,</hi> unto whom, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in the year before, 1632, had committed the chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of warfare, one <hi>Farenſtsbek</hi> aſſiſting him, was to deliver up Ingolſtade on the 4th of May.</p>
                     <p>And indeed the good ſucceſſe of War was at this time almoſt every where contrary unto the Emperour's forces. So that <hi>Vina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien,</hi> having vanquiſhed <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> turns away the warlike wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons from Pomerania, and takes Chame and Straubinge into his poſſeſſion. So, by <hi>Enhuſe,</hi> in a haſty and diſorderly Combat, in Alſatia, there are 400 of the Emperour's ſlain, and as many taken: And <hi>Fridland</hi> himſelf fights with the like loſſe at Olave in Sileſia; but at Oppele he loſt no more than three hundred: And which is more than ordinary remarkable, <hi>Dellone</hi> in Swethland brings forth but an hundred and fifty, which was on the 4th of June 1633, and puts 600 of the Emperour's Souldiers to flight.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame year the Proteſtants of Germany hold an Aſſembly at Hailbrunne, where they renew their League and Covenant with the Swedes, &amp; they appoint a giver of inſtructions, and frame a Councel. All religious perſons ſo called, that refuſed to take an oath from the Swedes, were commanded to depart. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they meet together at Frankford; where the ſayling into both the Indies that had been begun ſix years before, was enlarged with the priviledges of Guſtaveburg. Yet the Emperians take this year Frankford into poſſeſſion; And the Duke of Saxony en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to recover it, but all in vain.</p>
                     <p>But in the year 1634, both parties ſeem to beſtirr themſelves, although not with a like ſucceſſe; for the Swedes overcome Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatia, and likewiſe the Bavarians that were about to help <hi>Wiltzburg.</hi> Alſo the conſpiracy of <hi>Seleſtade</hi> was diſcovered to the Swedes. And beſieging Rheinsfield, they take it, putting the Emperians to the ſword. Philippiburg is yielded to <hi>Smidberger</hi> on Janu. the 10th; which place, the French did much deſire for himſelf. In the mean time, <hi>Horn</hi> is buſied in Sileſia, where the Emperour's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces take Wartenberg by ſurrender, but Namſlave by force. But <hi>Dranderf</hi> is beaten. <hi>Altenburgick</hi> moveth into Alſatia, and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſheth Budiſſine, Gorlete, and having the upper hand of Arn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim, he ſlew 4000, and took 1400; alſo Clogove, and other
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:33388:220"/>places, whoſe religious rites the Emperians do change. Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford at Viader cometh into the power of the Swedes. <hi>Croſsa,</hi> to <hi>Bannier</hi> being furniſhed with twenty thouſand Souldiers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon there is peace inſiſted upon at Licomerice, but in vain. Hirs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg is forſaken and burned by the Emperians in the moneth of July of this year. But the Swedes having the upper hand through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Swethland and the upper Palatinate, <hi>Dubabell</hi> maketh the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varians flee out of Chame. In the ſame year alſo, <hi>Vinarien</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegeth Forcheym; and the Duke of Saxony, Sittave. <hi>Horn</hi> alſo taketh Aicha; alſo <hi>Bannier</hi> breaketh into Bohemia, though to no purpoſe, while both <hi>Vinarien</hi> and <hi>Horn</hi> haſten to ſecure Ratisbone. And about this time, the higheſt power of managing the War, was committed unto the Elector of Saxony throughout both his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. <hi>Steinford</hi> being ſubdued, <hi>Boninghauſe</hi> is put to flight, while as in the mean time, <hi>Guſtave,</hi> kinſman of King <hi>Guſtavus</hi> is made a powerful Lord of Oſnabrugenſe, and there brings in the religious rites of the Proteſtants. Then alſo the lower Saxony held an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at <hi>Halberſtade,</hi> and decreeth to take up arms in their own defence. Then the Swedes crave ayd of the Hollander, and ſo get the Maſterdome. And among other toſſings, Luna, (a Town in Hetruria, ſo called from its marble Mines, ſhining like the Moon) was four times taken.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the 14th of February, this year proved fatall unto <hi>Fridland</hi> the Emperour's Embaſſadour, and Captain of all his Souldiery, who (either undergoing envy, or through the malignity of a tongue at will, or too bitter and ſharp a command, or through ambition of others, or through ſuſpition of the Proteſtant Religion, not ſincerely renounced) is, as it were, ſmelled out, and <hi>Galaſse</hi> put into his place, being about to paſſe over to the Proteſtant parties, is thruſt thorow at Eger; in which day alſo <hi>Schafgotſch</hi> is laid hold of in Sileſia, and in the year following beheaded, and <hi>Lawenburgick</hi> on the 16 day, who was ignorant of matters. But hereupon it came to paſſe, that the Emperour's warfare, untill that his ſon the King of Hungary, the Captains requiring it, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with pay for the Souldiers, was put upon the Army, was but in an unſettled and floating condition.</p>
                     <p>So that the Count of Rhene in the beginning of March following kills 1500 of the Emperour's Souldiers in Alſatia: taketh <hi>Tanna Bellaford,</hi> and other places; and ſome ſurrender of their own accord: In the ſame Alſatia, the Argentines diſcovered Treaſon. And they burn the poyſonſome perſon (if he were ſo) who did accuſe the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites as the beginners of it in the year 1633. While the Swedes vanquiſh the Fort of Hunning, <hi>Horn</hi> as a Conquerour, ſubdueth Bibrack, Campodune, and other places.</p>
                     <p>The King of Hungary, General of the Emperians, not idle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegeth Ratisbone, having ſtopped up the paſſages, whom <hi>Vina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien</hi> that was no body being turned from his Arms, vainly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>youreth to break thorow: So that the City was yielded on the 16th of July following, unto him, and Kaufber a little after, whereby the Saxon is inclined unto a peace-making.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vinarien</hi> was the author, that Philippiburg, which but lately was ſtoutly denyed, is delivered up to the French, whither he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (having gathered together a ſcattered Souldiery at the lower Maenus, his other affairs being loſt) came for help. The Spaniſh Oratour complaining to the Biſhop of Rome concerning that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, having, it ſeemeth, an evil eye, as thinking it too good for him; received this anſwer, <hi>We muſt not envy a Brother, becauſe a Stranger held it.</hi> Which words implyed a toleration of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, even to a brother, in ſome caſes. How far then was he from loving his enemies? Heidelberg is now yielded to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</p>
                     <p>The Infanta of Spain at that time brought 6500 foot, and 1500 horſe, at the intreaty of the King of Hungary; and, beſides many Towns taken through the Lower-Francony, got a victory at Nord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingon the 26 and 27 of Auguſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Oxienſtern</hi> now ſeeing the fortunous hazard of the Swedes to be too largely ſpread, hath a meeting of the Proteſtants at Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford in the moneth of March, and another at Worms, about the middle of November, where the Duke of Neoburg deſireth to be excuſed as not to meddle with either party; and it is decreed amongſt them, that <hi>Furſtenberger</hi> and <hi>Geleene</hi> go unto <hi>Philip,</hi> (who in the Juliacan Mountain, and Berganian Field, muſtred an Army) to deſire ayds from the Hollanders: The while Herbipolis is made ſubject unto the Emperians, the City of Argentine refuſeth the protection of the French, whether it were through fear of the one, or miſtruſt of the other's fidelity; The Landgrave of Haſſia is put to flight at Hirsfield; The Ligiſtians go into Wetterave, where they obtain Braunefelſe, who yielded themſelves willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but two Towns, Fridberg and Buding, they take by force.</p>
                     <p>But in Belgium alſo, or the Low-Countreys, there were no ſmall preparations of War made, in the year 1632. For the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers on the 21 of May take Venloe, and afterwards nearer pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into their poſſeſſion. They alſo confirm the continuance of the ſiege of Trajectum, at Moſe, and ſtop 140 Waggons of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of victual of the enemies. They give <hi>Papenheim</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perian Commander, (who was ſlain, not long after <hi>Guſtave</hi>) a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant repulſe, and after the ſurrender of the ſaid Trajectum, they ſubdue alſo Limburg and other places. Alſo the 15th of October following, <hi>Orfoy;</hi> when as in order to the work, <hi>William</hi> of Naſſaw had from the beginning ſeiſed upon ſome Munitions between Antwerp and Bergubzome.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the year after, which is 1633, while they contend with the Spaniard, Auriack or Orange beſiegeth Rheinberck, and taketh it, the Spaniards fortifying the Iſland of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but in the mean time, <hi>William</hi> of Naſſaw in lieu of it ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away quickly Stellate and Philippine.</p>
                     <p>This year alſo the Hollanders make large progreſſes into the Weſt-Indies, and ſuffer a moſt grievous overflowing of waters; but then again to make up their loſſes, they ſnatch two ſhips out
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:33388:221"/>of the Eaſt, (were they not our Merchant-men coming home? who, it's more than probable, were thrown over-board by them for the pelſs ſake) with ſixty Tuns of gold.</p>
                     <p>Alſo in the year 1644, theſe Hollanders they vanquiſhed the Fortreſſe of great Rivum in the other Weſtern World: They receive three ſhips from Guiny, bringing 1044 pound weight of gold, they poſſeſſe the head of Auguſtine; they chaſtize the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of Memphis: They bring the Iſland called Paccuvia, <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becce</hi> being their Leader, under the yoak. Then they receive ſeven ſhips out of the Eaſt-Indies, they poſſeſſe the Iſland where there is the beſt Indian ſalt, they quickly take Paraibas, a moſt famous place.

                     <p>In this year alſo on the eleventh of February, happened that lamentable and grievous fire on <hi>London</hi>-Bridge, which (by the judgment of many) had not the hand of God been ſeen in the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den turning of the wind, (which before drave it toward the City) when it came to the bottome of Fiſh-Street-hill, would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the deſolation of <hi>London,</hi> there being ſo much fit fuell in the adjacent ſtreet for the fire to feed upon. <hi>As London then eſcaped agreat, and ſince, noſmall dangers; ſo let her take heed of abuſing too too much her breathing time, and day of Viſitation: For though either Places, Perſon, or Perſons, have been once and again delivered, yet they cannot ſing a perpetuall ſafety unto themſelves.</hi> For we ſee that <hi>Charls</hi> the late King, (who when he went, in his Princedome, with <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> in to <hi>Spain,</hi> being in no ſmall danger, is ſaid to have kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground as a token of his ſafe arrivall); and afterwards in the ninth year of his reign 1633.

But if the one had been then made but Juſtice of the Peace, (as he afterwards ſaid, when too late, he ſhould deſire to be no higher) and the other but Parſon of ſome private Pariſh; whatever weight the leſſe might have layen on their Souls, yet in regard of their bodies, an untimely death might have been prevented; for that of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian is many times verified. <hi>Ubi maxima fortuna, ibi minima licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia;</hi> That is, <hi>Where there is the greateſt Worldly fortune, there is the leaſt liberty.</hi>

He alſo ſtrikes a peace (being firſt well weighed) of the Empire with the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> at <hi>Pirnedreſde,</hi> he garniſheth and ſtrengthneth the ſame peace, the ſeditious rude ones of <hi>Styre</hi> being firſt appeaſed, and tamed by his Commander <hi>Swartzburg,</hi> on the twenty ninth and thirtieth of May, at <hi>Prague,</hi> (for all this fair weather of Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all correſpondency in the forementioned particulars) he being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded with by the <hi>Saxon</hi> in the behalf of the <hi>Sileſians,</hi> as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a favourable toleration in their Religious Rites, (ſuch is the obſtinacy of blind devotion) remains unmoveable. Of which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Pope was joyful, and had a deſire to pacify the <hi>French.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This peace made, and confirmed at <hi>Prague,</hi> many or moſt of the States of <hi>Prague</hi> like of, and accept; Notwithſtanding (old friends being loath to part) the <hi>Swedes</hi> cannot be ſent away from the <hi>Saxon,</hi> even after a long diſputation, and the endeavour of the <hi>Megapolitane,</hi> yea, although the Emperour had written an Order for the withdrawing of the Warfare. But as the <hi>Saxons</hi> were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on going, ſo other ſupplies came in the room: for <hi>Vinarien</hi> goes againſt <hi>Galaſse,</hi> beyond <hi>Sare,</hi> and being increaſed in number through freſh ſupplies of the <hi>French,</hi> had beat back <hi>Galaſse,</hi> but
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:33388:223"/>that <hi>Landſtall</hi> had afforded ſuccour to this, and terrour to the other. However he freeth <hi>Mentz</hi> from beſieging, and frames a bridge, attempting ſome other matter. But in his return through <hi>VVester</hi> unto <hi>Metis, Galaſse</hi> following after him, although below him in forces, he gives him an overthrow, yet at <hi>Sare</hi> he paſſeth not over without ſlaughter, and in a <hi>French</hi> field, refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his tattered Army. To ſpeak of all particular paſſages, would be too tedious, and not agreeable to the former Account. But then, above eighty thouſand of the Emperians, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of three Captains, <hi>Galaſse</hi> and <hi>Grane,</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> were ſeen ready to invade <hi>France,</hi> and encamping at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi> and <hi>Rambervill</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> they, with the <hi>French,</hi> and alſo <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narien,</hi> are tormented with hunger. And at that time the <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainer</hi> deſtroyeth no leſs than 400 Villages on the borders of <hi>France,</hi> with Fire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Craze</hi> alſo (who in the year 1633. was offended and offenſive to <hi>Fridland</hi>) in this year 1635. in the Moneth of <hi>May</hi> followes him even in the ſame kind of death, with the Sword, <hi>(Thus death ends theſe Earthly Controverſies).</hi> And one <hi>Scaffgith</hi> eight daies after, followed him, both at <hi>Vienne:</hi> where alſo in the ſame Moneth, a horrible Tempeſt with Lightning burnt the Scotch Tower unto the Stones, and with the fervency of the flame, melted the Bells. The <hi>Saxon</hi> (being of a friend become an enemy) about the ſame time, joyneth together with the Emperours forces at <hi>Sandave</hi> in <hi>Sileſia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that in the year following 1636. in divers places there was cruell and raging war on both ſides. For <hi>Kniphuſe</hi> his weapons, the <hi>Swede,</hi> and the weapons of <hi>Luderſheyme</hi> the Emperian, glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> to ſhine; and on the very firſt day of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, do afflict one another with mutuall ſlaughter and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Then <hi>Crateſteyn</hi> of <hi>Kniphuſe,</hi> and <hi>Geleen</hi> of <hi>Luderſheyme,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the ſame changes, and take their warlike turn. Alſo one <hi>Klitſing</hi> was not wanting in his endeavours for the Emperours party, who notwithſtanding being unproſperous in battel, leads away into <hi>Sileſia,</hi> and was forced to deliver up the Province un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Gaece.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Bannier,</hi> aloft, carrieth about the chief of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Arms, and ſuddenly paſſeth over the River <hi>Albis,</hi> and making four aſſaults on <hi>Barbye,</hi> at the fifth onſet takes it; He ſubdueth <hi>Miſne.</hi> Yet (that he might not boaſt too much) he yieldeth two Legions (no leſſe) unto <hi>Baudiſſine</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> (with whom <hi>Hatsfield,</hi> together with <hi>Ulefield,</hi> had joyned the Emperian Auxiliaries) to be beaten. So alſo <hi>Magdeburg</hi> is loſt to him, with <hi>Bernburg,</hi> whilſt that he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth <hi>Iſawlisk</hi> at <hi>Sanderſleve,</hi> and takes the Fort of <hi>Winſenne;</hi> But departing in a more calm manner through <hi>Marchia,</hi> at <hi>Witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock,</hi> he obtains a plentifull Victory of the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Emperians,</hi> or <hi>Saxons</hi> turned <hi>Emperians,</hi> where about the middle of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he ſcattered them, took away all their Guns, Carriages, Bag, and Baggage, and quitted them of the field. From hence he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:33388:224"/>away to ſcourge <hi>Thuringe,</hi> and at the length, in the heighth of December threatning <hi>Erford</hi> with fire and Sword, he obtains it. When as he beſiegeth <hi>Mansfield,</hi> the which made not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render untill the year 1639. in the Moneth of Aprill, he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Saxons</hi> running thither to help it; and moreover he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Naumberg,</hi> and <hi>Torgave,</hi> with other places unto a heap of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories.</p>
                     <p>The Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> (to make yet hotter work) calls forth his Countreymen that ſtayed behind (by a publique Letter) out of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Camps, and together with the Emperians, he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth <hi>Havelberge,</hi> and <hi>Ratherave,</hi> and after the ſtrengthening of the Garriſons of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> he calls away <hi>Marazine,</hi> and ſo gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his Army and their enterpriſes unto the Emperour, to be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over into the hand of <hi>Hatsfield.</hi> And then the Emperour thought a little after, in requitall of the <hi>French</hi>) as we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) to invade <hi>France,</hi> and to extend the ſeat of war beyond the bounds of <hi>Germany,</hi> to which end he had proclaimed aſſemblies for Election of Officers. Wherefore the <hi>Lorrainer</hi> makes aſſault on <hi>Burgundy,</hi> where the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> being at the ſiege of <hi>Dole</hi> (at his approach) betakes himſelf unto a voluntary flight: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo four of the Emperours Commanders, <hi>Galaſſe, Lamboy, Merce,</hi> and <hi>Iſolane,</hi> trouble <hi>French-Burgundy,</hi> untill <hi>Vinarien,</hi> being joyned with <hi>Valettane,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Commander, taking <hi>Rambervill,</hi> and ſome other places firſt, ſcattered the Emperians, whereby they were called back again, without doing any thing that might be ſaid worth their labour, and ſo ſit down at <hi>Druſenheyme,</hi> at the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Alſatia,</hi> which is on the left bank of <hi>Rhene,</hi> onely beſieging <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genoe</hi> by the way.</p>
                     <p>This year alſo the Emperour gave a <hi>Tartarian</hi> Embaſſadour a hearing, who promiſeth him aids, though undetermined what; but he kept him from his Countrey, either as a ſawcy Gueſt, or an enemy.</p>
                     <p>He alloweth alſo the Garriſon of <hi>Uratſlave</hi> for defence unto our Earl of <hi>Arundell,</hi> going over this year, in the name of the <hi>Brittain</hi> King, to require a reſtoring of the <hi>Palſgrave:</hi> he had a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous hearing at <hi>Lince,</hi> but more courteouſly ſent away; words and complements are but Wind.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Geleen</hi> runs in the year 1637, with evil ſucceſſe upon <hi>Wrangle,</hi> and <hi>Funce</hi> bends into Sileſia, that he might oppoſe <hi>Wrangle,</hi> who endeavoured to compaſſe <hi>Cuſtrine;</hi> and in the mean while <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier</hi> was neceſſitated to forſake Lipſia, that was ready to yield, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Hatsfield, Galaſse,</hi> and <hi>Gaece</hi> being ſent for, ran thither, out of the Jenian ground that had been laid waſte. He takes a Fort that lay againſt Wittemberg-bridge, (although (the ball being ſo toſſed on both ſides) he held it ſcarce two moneths ſpace) that he might draw back the Emperians from Erford; the which the Saxon ſuppoſed was wholly beſieged. But at Torgave he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:33388:224"/>with no leſſe than ninety five thouſand Warriours; And yet, (ſee how diſcord weakeneth!) through the contention of the beſiegers, he ſlips forth, even to Landsberg and Cuſtrine. The Saxon beſtirring himſelf, makes (what by force and policy) a Fort and two other places his own, while the Emperians vanquiſh three more, Wolgaſt, Damnine Town, and Luneburg, a Field-Commander; but <hi>Bannier</hi> ſtronger than he, retakes Werbene Fort from the Saxons, afterward being partaker of a ſupply from Wolline, he had eſcaped, drawing after him 30000, and at laſt goeth in an afflicted condition into Sileſia.

Alſo <hi>Uladiſlaus</hi> King of Poland in 1637, couples to himſelf <hi>Cicill Renate</hi> the Arch-Dutcheſs, at <hi>Vienna,</hi> his brother repreſenting him. In which year alſo a Plague paſſed through all Germany, with the United Provinces of the Low-Countreys. <hi>Hot Anger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which Polander had, on the third of January this year 1635, entred into Thuronia, and <hi>Garde</hi> the Swede hath under his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſixty thouſand footmen, and four thouſand horſemen, in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſſia, and was attentively heedful on his opportunity; but a peace comes in between them, in the height of July, for a league of twenty four years. But how I pray was this league kept? have they not fought ſince? What then was this great ſhew for? Nay, is not the Swede at this day preparing for fear of him, and the 24 years are not yet up? All this then was little better than
<q>
                           <l>The King of France with fourty thouſand men</l>
                           <l>Went up a hill, and ſo came down agen.</l>
                        </q> Yet this it appears, Polands peace, afforded a very ravenous mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary homebred Souldier both to the Swede and Emperour, ſome taking one ſide, ſome another, according to their looſe affections, or where was beſt pay; and hereupon the King of Hungary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegeth,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:33388:225"/>Heidelberg, Hannove, and other places, his father the Emperour takes Lutrea by force and ſlaughter, Landſtull by craft.</p>
                     <p>But the French King (great danger accompanying great world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour) was laid in wait for, in 1635, at three ſeveral places, Paris, Nance, and Abbevil, but the adverſaries attempts were fruſtrated; whereupon three were committed to a ſlaviſh impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment <hi>Pylaurence, Fargyſe,</hi> and <hi>Monpenſer:</hi> Having proclaimed war againſt the Spaniard, amongſt other atchievements, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh him at Hoy (<hi>Caſtilion</hi> being General there) with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary advantage, there being 3000 of the Spaniards, and but 100 of the French ſlain: there were alſo taken then by the French, three of great note, <hi>Ferian, Charls</hi> of Auſtria, and <hi>Ladro,</hi> beſides twelve Captains, who afterwards, two of their keepers being by reward corrupted, made an eſcape. And in the year 1637, they make great preparations againſt the triumphing ſcorn of their enemies; and the French King maintains the two Iſlands of <hi>Margaret</hi> and <hi>Honoratus</hi> (being it ſeems of great concernment to his affairs) with great might and main. The Emperour's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alſo invading Burgundy, he drives them out of that Province, where he vanquiſheth the Temple of [Love] ſo called. Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is alway conquered, but doth not conquer, where the ſword bears ſway. But from the Rhetians he heard no good news, for two reaſons, becauſe the Souldiery was not paid off; and (no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) becauſe the Roman devotions were brought back again, with a ſuppreſſion of thoſe of a contrary opinion, the Duke of Rhoan much labouring therein.</p>
                     <p>The Engliſh King frames a huge Fleet in 1637, as it was then ſaid, for reſtraining, or ſubduing the Sea. But whether there might not be ſome other end in it; for he intercedes that year with the Emperour, in the behalf of the Palatinate; And (it ſeems the Spaniards were then in the Engliſh books) makes a ſtop of the Hollanders at Plymouth, for ſpoyling the Spaniards. Again he trimms and prepares a Navy in 1637, and 'twas que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned by ſome, whether to reſtore the Palſgrave by foul means, ſeeing fair would not do? or to ſubdue his own ſubjects upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion at hand?

And not onely in England, but about ſix moneths after ſending a book of Liturgy, ſo called, into Scotland, to be impoſed on them, that were generally leſſe able to bear it: and thereupon the Scots firſt Petitioning the King againſt it in the October following, and the ſame moneth entring into a Covenant againſt that and ſuch other things; the King (in whoſe name and authority all things were carried on) might well ſee a ſtorm ariſing, and ſo make prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which, although, at firſt, it was but as <hi>Eliah</hi>'s cloud, like a man's hand, yet it grew to ſuch an over-flowing ſcourge, as both Nations have ſince moſt ſadly experienced.</p>
                     <p>The Spaniard, amongſt the reſt, keeps doing; he beſiegeth Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippine (that he had loſt in 1633) in 1635, yet to no purpoſe; yet as he gets not that: So he renders the ſiege of Leody by <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Caſtilion,</hi> void. He loſeth of his Neapolitan Navy, by a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, nine Oar Galleys, fifteen bigger ſhips, with ſix thouſand men of war, this year: and at <hi>Lisbone</hi> ten Gallies with Oars, and 30 ſayling Veſſels, with 6000 men of war.</p>
                     <p>The Dutch warr but ſlowly this year 1636; but in 1637, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they loſt <hi>Greffling</hi> Fort by ſubtilty, it being, as it were, wrung out of their hands, yet they, after they had attempted Hulſt, beſiege Bredah with labour and difficulty, and conſtrain the Spaniards to yield, being nothing diſcouraged at the loſſe of <hi>Venlo.</hi> To cheer their hearts, they hear about this time good news from <hi>Naſsave,</hi> that they had ſent before into America, and receive great ſhips laden with Gold, Ivory, Copper, Pepper, Sugar, and Scarlet wood.</p>
                     <p>But the Turks and Perſians alſo contend (in 1635) in battel; the Turks took the Town called Rava, from the Perſians, not by ſtorm, but ſurrender; and in the battel were ſlain 90000 Turks, 20000 Perſians; and yet the Turk was the Conquerour, becauſe the more numerous. Then he burns four Villages belonging to Buda, and kills fifty poor mortals, and carryeth away ſeventy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſlavery; when as the moneth of Auguſt before he had almoſt burn'd down Buda it ſelf with fire. <hi>Behold the deſolations of the Earth, for want of the King of Peace to rule!</hi>

                     <p>Before I conclude this Chapter, I cannot but take notice of ſome remarkable Prodigies and Accidents that fell out in divers places in 1634, and 1635: An Eagle at Frankford of Menus, caſt down in a leaden bowl. England ſhook and trembled, about <hi>London,</hi> a Marſh there boyling with black waters, &amp;c. At <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rune,</hi> water turn'd into bloud. At <hi>Witteberg</hi> it rained brimſtone; with divers other like. There fell Hail of three pound weight in a field of <hi>Darmſtade,</hi> in 1636. At Paris in their religious Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, a bridge brake as they paſſed over, thirty were choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eighty hurt. At Duſſeldorp three hundred barrels of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder took fire in a houſe, and laid fifty adjacent houſes level;
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:33388:226"/>all the people thereof had almoſt ſome hurt: and a braſſe Gun is caſt abroad, off from a bull wark that was on the other ſide the River Rhene; in 1635, an Earthquake in Meſſina, the Veſuvian Mountain is again in a flame; and at the latter end of this year the Swedes loſt 30 ſhips by a ſtorm. There was alſo great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of forreign birds, and madneſſe of dogs at <hi>Straubinge.</hi> And laſtly, (which is almoſt incredible, yet all things are poſſible unto God) one <hi>Daniel Becker</hi> telleth of a man whoſe name was <hi>Andrew Grunheyd,</hi> living in a place called <hi>Grunevald,</hi> ſeven miles from the City <hi>Regimont,</hi> who on the 29th day of May, 1635, going about to caſt out his nauſeouſneſſe, or that which he had a deſire to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit up, before noon, lets a knife into his throat, to that end, above the breadth of ten fingers in length, and ſuffering it to ſlip out of the tops of his fingers, it ſticking there faſt, nor ſliding back again, although he were lifted upright on his head; moved it forward by drinking Beer or Ale. The Phyſitians of Regimont come to this man on the 9th of July following, which was above five weeks after, and they open his skin, fleſh, and ſtomach it ſelf, they draw out the knife, and reſtore the mangled, wounded man to health, who alſo afterwards married, and begat Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>FErdinand</hi> the ſecond being deceaſed; the year following, 1638, The Swediſh party (whether through the force of warlique valour, or partly occaſioned by the Emperour's death) proceeded againſt their Adverſaries with great ſucceſſe. For both the Duke of <hi>Vinarien</hi> returning ſuddenly and unthought of, out of Burgundy, unto Rhene; and alſo a little after, the Swediſh forces being brought back unto the Baltick Sea, performed divers noble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits.</p>
                     <p>The occaſion of his ſudden return thither, was the news that he heard, of about 14 Brigandines, or Coats of cruſt of clay made to caſt off the water, that were placed in Rhenes banks, to have yielded through the power of <hi>Werth.</hi> After his coming, he beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Rheinfield,</hi> and fighting his enemies in two battels, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, at length he overcometh, and took priſoners of war, <hi>Werth, Enkford, Spereutea, Fruſtenberger,</hi> with other Captains, and <hi>Savell,</hi> who deceived his keepers, by ſlipping away in an old womans ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit: unto this place, by incredible enforcement of endeavour, and conqueſt, he ſubdueth Fridburg, a Town or City of Briſgove, and he laid traps for <hi>Briſack</hi> Lord of the Rhene, to hinder it from proviſion, in as much as he knew the old ſtore of victual was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the Army, and that himſelf might be able to ſtop the new. Whereupon two great Emperian Commanders, <hi>Gaece,</hi> and the Duke of Lorrain run to help; but both with ill luck and
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:33388:227"/>ſlaughter: of which alſo <hi>Lamboy</hi> putting in for an oppoſer, made himſelf a partaker. And both parties (what about bringing in victual, deſtroying a bridge, and ſpoyling and overthrowing each others Camps) fought moſt ſharply, for the ſpace of 4 moneths, with a doubtful event of War and loſſe; but the <hi>Vinurne</hi> Duke kept them ſo long in play, untill that moſt fortified place, through moſt cruel famine, of which one thing alone, (and that enough) it knew the force, came to yield. But this place coſt hot water, conſuming on both ſides, above 80000 men: and ſpent the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour of the Imperialiſts 1100000 pounds; which charge or principal ſumme, nevertheleſſe, being taken, my author tells me, it reſtored with a moſt large uſury. Then at the aforeſaid Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Sea; theſe Swedes were altogether dreadful to their enemies, both defenſively and offenſively: For they couragiouſly defend <hi>Rugye</hi> againſt the Emperour's forces: and having increaſed their own forces, wring (as it were) Gartiſe out of the hand of the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg;</hi> and from the Saxon Warbnian, Wolgaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a Caſtle: and being ſuddenly overcharged in their moſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry legions, they, in a military fury, rifle or caſt to the ground, or both, <hi>Malchine</hi> and <hi>Bernave.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While, or a little after, that the Emperour courted the King of Poland with ſumptuous entertainment at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and moſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly receiveth the Duke of Saxony, with his ſons at <hi>Leutmerice,</hi> ſends an Embaſſage by <hi>Eggenberg</hi> unto the Biſhop of Rome; and on the day before the Ides of December, undergoeth perill in hunting, the vehement force of a wind throwing down Trees; the Duke of Lorrain fights ſtoutly, throughout Burgundy, Alſatia, and Lorrain; but partly (as may be well ſuppoſed) through his bearing ill-will to <hi>Gaece,</hi> by reaſon of emulous ſtrife, the mother of confuſion, he is often beaten; whereby alſo the ſaid <hi>Gaece</hi> being diſarmed, was by <hi>Mansfield</hi> brought before the Duke of Bavaria to render an account of his ordering the warfare; and in which he gave him ſatisfaction. But the ſaid Duke of Lorrain, (who although he held Eſpinal and other places, that were judged to be of great concernment, either to withdraw from or overcome <hi>Vinurn</hi> at <hi>Briſack,</hi> yet he prevailed nothing, as above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; Being himſelf diſperſed at <hi>Thanne,</hi> was conſtrained to betake himſelf into a Wood, out of which (by a witty device, to wit, ſmall ropes being made of ſhrubs, and hung upon every ſide, by the light of fire-balls when they are caſt) he by night brought forth all, one by one. There being alſo ſome Eccleſiaſticall tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult (as I may ſo ſpeak) about this time at <hi>Bremes,</hi> about a Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral, which their new Archbiſhop had given unto the lovers of his ſect.</p>
                     <p>But the Swediſh forces, the year following alſo 1639, luſtily act <hi>Mars</hi> his part, when as the Emperour's forces did but little execution; for after the Duke of Viburn had <hi>Briſack</hi> ſurtendred unto him, he takes <hi>Landiſcrone,</hi> and muſtering 11000, goes away into Burgundy to winter: neither was he there idle, but by great
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:33388:227"/>endeavour ſubdueth <hi>Pontarly,</hi> and almoſt all <hi>Burgundy,</hi> he takes into poſſeſſion the narrow paſſages, even unto <hi>Mortave,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the Caſtle of <hi>Jaux,</hi> the loſſe of which the Lievtenant or Governour purged away with the loſſe of his head; the <hi>Spaniard</hi> alſo a long time after beſieging it, but in vain. And at length <hi>Thane,</hi> (with two Temples of <hi>Hippolytus</hi> and <hi>Claudius</hi>) where the <hi>Lorrainer</hi> had been ſcattered, being ſubdued, recruiting his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he ſets foreward for upper <hi>Germany,</hi> but ſoon breathed his laſt, as is thought, by poyſon. Whereupon the top of affairs was committed to the guidance of four perſons, <hi>Erlach, Otto</hi> Earl of <hi>Naſſaw, Roſe,</hi> and <hi>Oeheme;</hi> whom, that the <hi>French</hi> King (who it ſeemeth ſtood in as much, or more need of the <hi>Swedes</hi> friendſhip and aſſiſtance, than the other did of his) might make his own, (whether they loved him not, or ſuſpected him) he encounters them with a great ſumme of Money, and reneweth his League with the States of High-<hi>Germany,</hi> alſo a Generall of the Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added in <hi>Vinurne's</hi> room. But in the mean time theſe four Directours draw down unto the lower parts, where they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe <hi>Bungye, Oppenheyme,</hi> with other places, and paſſing over the River <hi>Rhene,</hi> meeting with <hi>Geleen</hi> the Emperian, are beaten by him in <hi>Rhingave:</hi> from whence going unto the land of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Triers,</hi> or <hi>Trevira,</hi> by reaſon of the enmities of <hi>Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> which being a City in <hi>Italy,</hi> I cannot learn what the ground of that enmity ſhould be, they uſe it in a hoſtile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>That I may not exceed the nature of this Account, let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Bannier's,</hi> with other <hi>Swediſh</hi> exploits of this year 1639, in few words. The one, not preferring <hi>Lipſia,</hi> takes <hi>Zwiccave Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and <hi>Altenburg</hi> into his poſſeſſion, alſo attempting <hi>Freyburg</hi> again and again, to no purpoſe; but he ſubdueth <hi>Pirnave, Auſige,</hi> and <hi>Leutimerice,</hi> with <hi>Tettſchine</hi> Caſtle. Then being increaſed by <hi>Tortenſon,</hi> gets a victory at <hi>Chemnice,</hi> where he takes thirty foot, and twenty Horſe Enſigns, beſides Priſoners of War, and (purſuing his Victory) followes <hi>Fruſtenberger</hi> into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> he quickly ſnatcheth <hi>Melnice,</hi> and <hi>Brandiſe,</hi> he fights again, and takes two great <hi>Emperians, Hoffkirch,</hi> and <hi>Montcucule.</hi> But withall he receiveth no ſmall check, in ſeeing four legions (in ſnatching after all warlike neceſſaries) to be diſperſed by the <hi>Hungarians;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he conquers again at <hi>Johnsbrode;</hi> where, through luſt or inordinate defire, his men had almoſt tumulted. While the other <hi>Swediſh</hi> parties are bringing under <hi>Wolflag,</hi> and <hi>Halle, Wrangell</hi> a Major, comes to them with 300 men, having before fallen off unto the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg.</hi> Alſo <hi>Axel Lilly,</hi> ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Damnum, Hornburg,</hi> and <hi>Maurice</hi> his Caſtle. Likewiſe other Captains take <hi>Burgſdorffe,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> his chief Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and <hi>Bernave</hi> a Town, the ſecond time. Then <hi>Koningſmart,</hi> conquering at <hi>Duderſtade,</hi> makes that Town, together with <hi>Gley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chenſteyne,</hi> and <hi>Glettenburg,</hi> his own, yet being buſied elſewhere, was thrown out of <hi>Bilefield. Lily Holk,</hi> and <hi>Lily Spart,</hi> coworking,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:33388:228"/>make five Towns acknowledg <hi>Swethland,</hi> whereof <hi>Frankford</hi> was one; two Towns, <hi>Dreiſia,</hi> and <hi>Beuzen,</hi> are taken with the ſlaughter of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> with ſome other things, <hi>quae nunc perſcribere longum eſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperour performed little, therefore I will briefly recite his deeds. He calls <hi>Hatsfield</hi> into <hi>Bobemia,</hi> and conferreth the higheſt command on the Arch-Duke, he alſo encourageth the <hi>Saxon</hi> to ſubdue <hi>Pirnave,</hi> that <hi>Bannier</hi> had taken a little before, and he attempteth it often, but in vain, as alſo <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Emperour alſo ſends away the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> into <hi>Livonia,</hi> where his Men under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Captain <hi>Hermanne Bottye</hi> are ſcattered, and <hi>Bottye</hi> himſelf taken.

                     <p>'Tis high time to caſt an eye upon the affairs of other Nations, and eſpecially on <hi>Brittain, Brittain</hi> I ſay, which (being environed with the Sea, of ſo conſiderable a bigneſſe, it being reputed, if not the greateſt of all, yet ſave one, the greateſt of Iſlands in the whole World, ſo fertile for all kind of neceſſary ſuſtenance, (with contentment) eſpecially <hi>England,</hi> that its inhabitants may live of themſelves, without the help of other Countries) is of a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate climate, and to be accounted amongſt the happieſt of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and which for a conſiderable number of years, I do not find had been, ſo much as in any eminent perill of ſorreign enemies, unleſſe't were in 1588. by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armado, nor but once in the jaws of death, by an undermining conſpiracy of a Powder-Plot, in its own bowels, from both which it received a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by a high hand of providence; Now about the year 1638, begins as was ſaid of <hi>Rome</hi> [<hi>ſuis viribus ruere</hi>] to fall and undo it ſelf by its own ſtrength: for (after the impoſing of many Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, the Book for ſports, and the Pillor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and baniſhment of thoſe three men, mentioned in the former Chapter, the Liturgy enjoyned to the Scottiſh Nation, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, on Aprill the eighth, 1638. <hi>John Lilburn</hi> a young man ſadly whipped at a Carts tail in <hi>London,</hi> and then pillored, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſpreading books in <hi>Holland,</hi> or elſewhere in behalf of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Prin,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> the Scots having firſt engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a Covenant, firſt are diſturbed among themſelves, (though with relation to what came from <hi>England</hi>) inſomuch that the Marqueſſe <hi>Hamilton</hi> their own countreyman and very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent amongſt them, went into <hi>Scotland,</hi> on May the ſixth, that by his perſonall preſence, behaviour, threatning, or perſwaſion, he might appeaſe tumults that were there raiſed, and ſo prevent a

The Scots went forward to meet the King, though not with diſplayed banners, and comming in ſight, as an humble token, that ſtubborn rebellion was not the cauſe of Arming, but rather a conſtrained neceſſity for defence and Vindication of their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, laid down their Arms on the ground before him. And when both ſides were ready to joyn bartell (Whether as not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſtrive with their fellow-ſubjects, or through a fear, at that time, poſſeſſing them) the <hi>Engliſh</hi> denied to fight; ſo that there was a neceſſity of a treaty with them, which began on the tenth of July following, and in eight dayes time was concluded, and the next day after, which was the 18th of July, the Armies began to be disbanded, the Scots had good conditions from the King, as with relation to their Covenant and charges, for ſuch was the bent of their ſpirits in that buſineſſe, that without thoſe, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to retreat.

                     <p>The French (<hi>Janus</hi>-like) in the year 1638, turn their faces with their weapons, two wayes; againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and alſo againſt the <hi>Lorrainer</hi> with the Emperour's forces.

<pb n="445" facs="tcp:33388:229"/>his liberty from the Emperour in the year 1641, the King of <hi>England</hi> himſelf had employment for him and his younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Maurice,</hi> in carrying on his War (as chief Commanders) againſt the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And then (as an addition to the Actions of the Emperour's Forces this year) the ſaid <hi>Hatsfield</hi> ſubdueth <hi>Vecta,</hi> a ſtrong place, with labour and toyl.</p>
                     <p>But the Spaniſh King alſo amongſt the reſt, ſtrikes, this year, on both ſides of him: for he on the one hand contends in Italy, and overcometh three places, <hi>Breme, Vercella,</hi> and <hi>Pomara;</hi> and in the <hi>Juliacan</hi> field, <hi>Kerper.</hi> On the other hand, he fights with the Dutch, with the like overthrow; for he puniſheth them moſt grievouſly at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> whither he defends the <hi>Calloane</hi> Fort, and <hi>Geldre</hi> moſt valiantly to their loſſe. And being ſome-body at Sea, as well as at Land, calls his Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> High-Admiral of three Seas. But (as a curb to a high ſpirit) the ſame year, in the very Haven of <hi>Texel,</hi> fourty of his ſhips periſhed by a tempeſt. But in the year following, 1639, <hi>Bellona</hi> or warlique affairs ſmiled upon him throughout Piedmont, a Province of the French: for the Spaniards make firſt of all the Camp of Gregui and Creſcence their own; then after that, the French, to withſtand them, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves together in the Suburbs of Taurine, fought the Spaniard; but although the battle was doubtfull enough, yet the Spaniard added to the other two, the place called <hi>Villa Nova,</hi> or New Village, with three other Towns. And made Trine, a Town rich both in proviſion and plunder, yea and Taurine it ſelf, with its Caſtle, beſides two other places, to obey him as a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. The French King on the contrary, leſt he ſhould ſeem to do nothing againſt his enemy, by two Leaders poſſeſſeth four pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Chivaſe,</hi> and <hi>Salſa</hi> in the County of Roſſilion, by the Prince of <hi>Conde; Lared</hi> and <hi>Anthonie</hi>'s Temple, at the <hi>Cantabrian</hi> Ocean in Biſcay, by the Biſhop of Burdegale, (whether through valour or policy) he overcometh; and alſo quickly ſnatcheth away two ſhips of Spain laden with great ſpoyls. At length both of them taſted the ſeat or ſtate of warlique weapons in Italy, the which was ſo wearyed with toſſings and tumblings to and fro, that at the latter end of the year <hi>Salſa</hi> was again yielded to the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Who doing diſpleaſure to the Trajectines of the River Moſe by Sea, felt the force of the Dutch Fleet in a Sea-fight at <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, <hi>Martin Trump</hi> being Conquerour; and toward the end of this year 1639, in a far more fierce one, a far greater loſſe; the <hi>Spaniard</hi> of 50 ſhips ſaving but 15: The two Navies pitching on the Engliſh Coaſt, the Engliſh interrupted them.</p>
                     <p>While theſe things were acting in Europe, the Turks in Aſia vanquiſhed Babylon in 1639, which was defended by the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> untill the Beſieger ſlew 40000 of the beſieged, but who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knoweth what he himſelf loſt? This grand Sultan <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> appoints a Navy to go, as far as the red Sea, againſt the <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks,</hi> and runs toward Breger in Hungary, devouring the prey; notwithſtanding the Plague being in the City Aleppo, makes

                     <p>That I may inſert a grain of Hony amongſt ſo much Gall, we may take notice, that in the year 1638, in a piece of ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Hungary, at the greater Waradine, amongſt the rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh of a burying Chappell deſtroyed by <hi>Bethlem</hi> Prince of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania, there was a treaſure found, with a port-mantle or ſome ſuch thing, with a diamond in bigneſſe of a hens egg. I find alſo three eminent marriages ſolemnized in theſe two years: one whereof was between <hi>Francis Charls</hi> Duke of Lawenburg, and the widow of <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> the foreſaid <hi>Tranſylvanian</hi> Prince, who dying in the year 1636, (I muſt recede a little) new troubles aroſe in <hi>Tranſylvania;</hi> after that, one <hi>Ragotzy</hi> enjoyed the affairs. <hi>Salymye</hi> of <hi>Bethlem</hi>'s family gathering 2000 Souldiers and more, in oppoſition of him, &amp;c. Thus much in the general. And it is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly reported, that in the ſame <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> there is a viſible Church, who maintain their orderly ſucceſſion of Ordinances from the Apoſtles times, by an adminiſtrator of baptiſm, without intermiſſion. Be it ſo: yet what is a ſucceſſion of the form, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the life and power they lived in?</p>
                     <p>Alſo of two male children born into the world; for which there is joy to the travailing mothers; the one to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria, Jerome</hi> by name, on the day before the Kal. of Octob. 1638; the other to the Duke of Lorrain's brother, named <hi>Ferdinand</hi> born at <hi>Vienne</hi> in 1639.

                     <p>By that time I have mentioned two or three things of note, it will be time to proceed unto the actions of the two other years, to be contained in this Chapter. At <hi>Vienna,</hi> the biggeſt Bell in the City ſounded of his own accord, none enforcing it, which to me ſeemeth not the leaſt of wonders. In the Prince's Court alſo of the ſame place, an Eagle of fifteen years old fell down dead: which ſeems not the leaſt of tokens. And (which is among the greateſt of wonderful things) a Chariot with 6 horſes, and five that were carried therein, was by the force of the wind caſt off from a long bridge into the River <hi>Danubius</hi> of the ſame <hi>Vienna.</hi> Theſe three in one year, to wit, in 1639.</p>
                     <p>Money (which is accounted the ſinews of War) being wanting to the Emperour; himſelf, with the Electors, Embaſſadours, and the Deputies of other States came together at Norimberg, in 1640; but there being nothing done at that meeting, there were the ſame year Aſſemblies of all ranks ſummoned at Ratisbone, where they treated both concerning raiſing money for carrying on the Warr, and alſo, of reſtoring the adminiſtration of Civil Juſtice in places where they could; which by reaſon of the wars, muſt needs have been either aboliſhed, or neglected.

                     <p>This Emperour, in a ſpecial manner, endeavours a peace with the Daniſh King this year; but luſtily encounters the Swediſh For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for (<hi>George</hi> Duke of Luneburg recovering Steynbruck, a Town before loſt) the Imperialiſts having <hi>Spork</hi> for their Leader, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form two conſiderable Services, by beating <hi>Ekard</hi> and <hi>Roſe,</hi> two Swediſh Commanders; and which is more, by driving <hi>Bannier</hi> out of Bohemia: but being ſomewhat diſperſed hereby, they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Army together, and ſit down at Salfield, and with this ſecond Army they recover Telchine Caſtle: Moreover, forcing <hi>Bannier</hi> to retire himſelf in the Lower-Haſſia; but, following him thither, as it ſeemeth, too hotly, although they were joyned with <hi>Geleen, Haeſe, Gonzage,</hi> and <hi>Hatsfield,</hi> they are there ſcattered. Theſe alſo vanquiſh three Towns more, and under the command of <hi>Golze,</hi> force <hi>Hirſchberg</hi> in Sileſia unto a demoliſhment; the <hi>Saxon</hi> Duke, the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and <hi>Truckmuller,</hi> at three ſeveral places with like Martial force, in the mean time earneſtly labouring, although in vain, and with ſlaughter of their men. The Pope amongſt all this, being urgently buſied to make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Kings.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that had been under the command of the Duke of <hi>Vinurn,</hi> on the contrary, are not idle, but do divide their company into three parts, poſſeſſing Wetterave, and ſpreading themſelves in three chief places thereof. The Emperians aſſault <hi>Bingium,</hi> the which being a place fit for paſſage or conveyance; the other ſharply defend againſt them; yet at laſt they loſe it: and ſetting their warfare in order, a heap of battels imploying them, they joyn with <hi>Bannier;</hi> and at the latter end of the year, do ſcatter and beat the Baron of <hi>Bredah</hi> at <hi>Zigenhayne:</hi> where alſo <hi>Roſe,</hi> a Major, takes a French Earl (full of gold and Brigandines) unthought of.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Bannier</hi> himſelf this year 1640, playes <hi>Rêx;</hi> he robbed and killed in Bohemia in the wayes as he went, and beheadeth the Confuls or chief Magiſtrates of two Towns, <hi>Satze</hi> and <hi>Cade,</hi> together with a Judge: after that, when the Emperour's forces had recovered two garriſons, he ſleighting another place, takes ſpeedily, although with ſome loſſe, <hi>Plane</hi>-Caſtle, very full of all ſort of victual: thence, while the Emperians overcome <hi>Chemnice,</hi> he departed to <hi>Erford,</hi> and being increaſed by other Armies, he oppoſed himſelf againſt them, who going forward to Salfield, had there reſted with 70 thouſand men. His wife now dying, being grieved (when he had firſt taken <hi>Fulda,</hi> and had heard a voyce in the ayr, <hi>Be gone, Bannier, be gone, for now the time is,</hi>) he went away to <hi>Eſchwege,</hi> and then joyns the forces of <hi>Durlace</hi> to himſelf,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:33388:231"/>whereby he wreſted that honorable Victory at <hi>Homburg</hi> in <hi>Haſsia</hi> aforementioned, from the Imperialiſts; which Conqueſt, the ſurrender of <hi>Amaenoburg</hi> followed; then returning back to <hi>Erford,</hi> be beſieged one place, and took another, now ready to ſtrive, if he could, to break into Bavaria: Into which to come, he bends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the beginning of 1641, and therefore calling to him <hi>Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brian,</hi> who was the French General of <hi>Vinurn</hi>'s Army, breaks thorow by fighting, and takes <hi>Chamice,</hi> as alſo cloaths appointed for the Emperour's Souldiers. But then letting go <hi>Guebrian</hi> to another place, while he was more ſecure than ordinary at a place ordained for hunting, that he had taken away from the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> he is invaded by the Emperians; and unleſs <hi>Schlange</hi> of Neoburg had before a Wood, valiantly reſiſted them, he had been quite overthrown. However, he was forced to redeem his eſcape into Bohemia with the loſſe of 26 Enſigns, and 1800 horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; yet perceiving the Conquerour to follow after him, he calls back <hi>Guebrian,</hi> and, at <hi>Zwiccave,</hi> is joyned with him.</p>
                     <p>Then again, at the River <hi>Sale,</hi> the chief of warlike matters (and the concluſion to <hi>Bannier</hi>) is joyned, where each party maintain a Bank; <hi>Bannier</hi> toughly, and (as I may ſay) with his teeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending his; yet at length being forced to yield, he goeth to <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſtade,</hi> where voyding much blood and matter, through an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume, or breaking of a vein, he put an end to his life, and ſo to all his toyl and labours; the Voyce, as may be well ſuppoſed, that he heard in the Ayr the year before, having reference rather unto this time of his death, than unto the Victory that he got a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, at <hi>Homburg.</hi> But the Swediſh forces (what through this Arch-warriour's death, what through this laſt repulſe at <hi>Sale</hi>) were broken both in ſtrength, and courage: yet not being wholly diſmayed, they ſtand waiting upon the Senate of <hi>Stockholm</hi> for new orders, who commanded <hi>Torſtenſohn</hi> to undergo, as General, <hi>Bannier</hi>'s charge and burden, who having received his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, paſſeth over the River Albis with a ſupply of his own, and joyns with the <hi>Bannerians;</hi> whereby they allayed the ſpirits of the Emperians that then were hot againſt them. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they having renewed their League with the Lantgrave of Heſſe, and the Duke of Luneburg, break thorow Wolſebyte, and (being reſolvedly bent) they beat and are beaten, untill the Duke of Luneburg could paſſe over unto the Emperour's party; which gave an occaſion to the <hi>Bannerians</hi> of moving elſe-where.</p>
                     <p>Many places were yielded to the Emperour's Souldiers this year; firſt the Town <hi>Crucinack</hi> with its Caſtle; then ſeven other conſiderable Cities and Town, with other places of leſs note. <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtene</hi> (ſomewhat remote) was after two moneths ſiege taken. <hi>Ein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> and alſo <hi>Clive</hi> were forced to yield, and that with a ſlaughter of the Haſſians who had come for relief; and in the mean time the Duke of Saxony, through very much labour and induſtry brings <hi>Gorlice</hi> under his power. In which year alſo (being 1641) by the Emperour (at Aſſemblies held at Ratisbone concerning a
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:33388:231"/>right managing the War, and ſupplying the ſaid War with ayds) <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Bregance,</hi> the natural brother of the valiant and diligent King in <hi>Portugal,</hi> is committed to cuſtody.</p>
                     <p>But in <hi>England,</hi> after <hi>Charls</hi> King of <hi>Britain</hi> was again eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the Scots a little after the pacification between them, and had diſavowed that Paper which the Scots, avouched to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein the true conditions of the ſame, and in teſtimony of his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt it, had commanded it to be burnt by the common Executioner, in the year 1639. he told his Privy-Councell about the beginning of December, the ſame year, that he intended to ſummon a Parliament, or Kingdom's Repreſentative in <hi>England,</hi> (which began on Aprill the thirteenth, in the year 1640) with which the ſubjects were even filled with hopes of redreſſes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things amiſſe, and almoſt with wonder, at the having of that, the name of which ſeemed to be ſtrange amongſt them; But their hopes were not anſwered herein; for the King being very urgent at the ſaid Parliament for money to War a ſecond time with the Scots, and to pay the Army that he had already raiſed in order thereto, which was to be done by that which they call <hi>[Subſidy],</hi> ſome Members preferring a redreſſe of grievances before the other, made ſpeeches to the ſame purpoſe: but yet they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſaid Subſidies into conſideration, while they were deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the buſineſſe, the King thinking (it ſeems) they were not Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall therein, and did it with delay, brake them up, on the fifth of May following, which was in the ſpace of three weeks. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, he continved the ſitting of the Convocation of their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy untill May the twenty ninth, (a thing never known ſo before) who, by his Authority, made Canons, and put Oaths upon ſome. And on the eighth of July following, the ſaid King had a third ſon born unto him, named <hi>Henry,</hi> and intituled Duke of <hi>Glouceſter.</hi> But the Scots upon new diſcontents enter <hi>England</hi> the ſecond time, on Auguſt the ſeventeenth, (their ſecond Parliament now ſitting again, June the ſecond, that had been adjourned from December the eighteenth, 1639.) againſt whom the King (having had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions from the Clergy and others) and iſſuing out Writs for Ship-money, and other waies undertaken for defraying the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the war) ſet forward toward the North of <hi>England</hi> with an Army, on the twentieth day of the ſame Auguſt, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Deputy, Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> (the Earl of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who was appoynted as Generall, not being in health) where having a fight, or rather a skirmiſh, at <hi>Newburn,</hi> on the twenty eighth day, and at another place far North, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſouldiers, not willing to engage in that cauſe, and many mutinying againſt their Officers; the King (who had on September the twentieth, ſet up his Standard of War at the City of <hi>York,</hi> and his Councill meeting there on the twenty fourth day) by a choice of ſome Lords of both Kingdomes, to compoſe the matter, at length came to a ceſſation of Arms with the Scots upon ſeven Articles on Oct. the twenty ſixth of the ſame year, untill Decemb. the ſixteenth
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:33388:232"/>following, which Armies were not disbanded until the beginning of Auguſt following, in the year 1641. In the mean time ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Peers and Barons, being ſomewhat ſenſible of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Nation, and what the conſequence of this war with their fellow-ſubjects, might be; do Petition their King to call another Parliament with ſpeed; who ſeeing a neceſſity thereof, as well as the Petitioners, acquainted his Councell at <hi>York</hi> of his intentions for a Parliament, which ſhould begin on Novemb. the third following, which Parliament (having the ſame year, Jan. the Eleventh, exhibited a Bill for one to be had every three years, and alſo May the tenth, in 1641, another bill for their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, untill they were willing to diſſolve, unto both which the King ſigned) ſate from November the third, 1640. unto Aprill the 20th, 1653. almoſt thirteen years, and therefore was by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> called the <hi>[Long-winded]</hi> Parliament. One of the firſt things this great Councel ſet upon, was to impeach thoſe whom they judged offenders againſt the Common-Wealth: the firſt of whom was the afore-ſaid Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> a deep Politician, who being committed to cuſtody, on the Eleventh day of November 1640. and to the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the two and twentieth of the ſame, and began to be tryed in a Pompous and remarkable manner on March the two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth following, upon nine Grand Articles, in the Hall of <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> whoſe triall ending April the fifteenth, 1641. was (being by his Judges, adjudged Guilty of High Treaſon) beheaded (the King having firſt ſigned to his Execution) on the 12th of May of the ſame year.</p>
                     <p>Another was, to cenſure and remove divers Miniſters of the Church that were ſcandalous, or ſuperſtitious, and to relieve and recompence thoſe who had been diligent, and Conſcientious ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament and people of <hi>England</hi> (at this time) loving the Scots, becauſe they looked on them as inſtruments, (by oppoſing the King) of procuring this means of their redreſſe, Commiſſioners from <hi>Scotland,</hi> had acceptable reſidence in <hi>London</hi> on the 19th of November 1640. the Parliament on the twelfth day of the ſame Moneth, before their comming thither, having by Vote ordered the Scots, in part of 300000 <abbr>lb.</abbr> no leſſe then 10000 <abbr>lb.</abbr> to be payed them, for ſupplying their loſſes and neceſſities. At the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of which Moneth, <hi>Pryn,</hi> and <hi>Burton,</hi> and within a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights time, <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> who had three years before, ſuffered as aboveſaid, were brought with triumph into the City from exile, about which time alſo there was Petitioning by the Londoners, againſt, not onely the miſdemeanors, but the very ſtanding of the Biſhops of their Church; and <hi>william Laud,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> was on the eighteenth day of December 1640. by the Great Councell of the Kingdome, ſequeſtred from all his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and (to the Kings grief) committed, firſt into the hands of the Uſher of the upperhouſe, which they call the black Rod, and on
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:33388:232"/>the eight and twentieth day of January following, unto a cloſer confinement in the Tower of <hi>London:</hi> and afterwards in the Moneth of November, 1641. there being tumults of the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> in the midſt of which, they declared againſt, and threatned the Biſhops; twelve of whom (having proteſted againſt the validity of the Parliaments votes in their abſence, the which, they ſaid, the danger of the tumultuous occaſioned) were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereupon of High Treaſon; ten whereof were ſent Priſoners to the Tower, the other two to the black Rod. Amongſt theſe things the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> King eſpouſed his eldeſt daughter <hi>Mary,</hi> unto <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſsaw,</hi> ſon of <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in the year 1640 and the ſaid young Prince comming to <hi>London</hi> on Aprill the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth 1641. (the Parliament being pleaſed with the marriage, the States of <hi>Holland's</hi> Ambaſſadours, make fair propoſals to the King) was with great ſolemnity married unto her on the ſecond of <hi>May,</hi> the ſame year, ſhe being then not above ten years of age, and the Prince about ſixteen.</p>
                     <p>The king alſo took a journey this year, on Auguſt the tenth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scotland</hi> (the Parliament intreating his longer ſtay, by reaſon of the kingdomes occaſions). Which proved a hinderance unto <hi>Englands</hi> affairs. And although the kings end of going at that time, was not by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> underſtood, yet a Scottiſh Writer ſaith, (for it was about the time of the two Armies disbanding) It was ſecretly to engage them againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament by large and fair promiſes, and alſo to take ſome Noble men of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> out of the way, whoſe willingneſſe therein he ſuſpected. But in the mean time, on October the three and twentieth, 1641. the conſpiracy of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> (ſo long kept cloſe) broke forth in a moſt bloudy manner againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Proteſtants there, ſo that in two Moneths ſpace, (beſides many great and grievous torments, and ſpoylings of worldly goods and eſtates) were murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no leſſe, (as is credibly reported) then 200000 Souls.

                        <hi>Amurath,</hi> Emperour of the Turks (who had the report of a good Souldier, but a great Tyrant) dying in the year 1640, the 33d year, the flowr of his age, his brother <hi>Ibraim,</hi> in the 27th year of his age, ſucceeded him; who continued his buſie endeavour of peace with the Perſian: but calling the Tartarians into his fellowſhip, threatneth a moſt cruel War on Poland; whoſe Pyrats alſo of Argier take a Spaniſh ſhip, valued to be worth 300000 Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens.</p>
                     <p>Three or four ſtrange and unuſual things happened in divers places within two years ſpace: The one was a Whale, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in a Province of France) left without water, on a place where the Tide ebbeth and floweth, was found to be 320 foot long, and 162 foot broad: This monſtrous King of Fiſhes, was nine dayes in deſtroying with Guns, as if 'twere ſhooting againſt a Caſtle; afterwards being drawn to ſhoar by 500 ſtrong armed men, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his chaps, they ſaw them eaſily to receive a horſe with his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Another was, a ſeven-fold off-ſpring brought forth at one birth in the Swediſh Camps, in the year 1640, four whereof were male-children, three female; the laſt of which received a baptiſm, and then gave up the ghoſt. Alſo at <hi>Stockholm</hi> in <hi>Sweden,</hi> on the 4th of the Ides of January, 1641, the whole Princes Court ſeemed to be very bright and ſhining with lights; and, which is the greateſt thing, three great Guns were heard to be diſcharged, without the moving of any mans hand, or fire unto them. But
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:33388:234"/>throughout <hi>Bavaria,</hi> in 1640, was there a ſpatious hunting made, as they ſay, by the Prince of darkneſſe, with howling cries, dogs, fleſh, and a company of ſervants, and divers wild beaſts; now ready after a while to go (as he ſaid) a fiſhing. This being true, as it is related, ſurely a lively ſign both of violence, by the hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and of deceit, by the fiſhing, in the earth,</p>
                     <p>Beſides thoſe mentioned in our diſcourſe by the way, theſe may be taken notice of in their deaths both naturall and violent. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> Prince of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and <hi>Marodas</hi> Duke of <hi>Prague; Francis Jacinth,</hi> Prince of Subaudia, a child; which three departed life in the year 1638. And the ſame year, one <hi>Cyril</hi> a Patriarch, that is, a chief father of the Greek Church, through the inſtigations or movings of his adverſaries at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was ſtrangled with a rope. <hi>Columna,</hi> Maſter of the Stable, dyed at Rome in the year 1639; in which year the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> loſt <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> his ſecond and third ſons, by death. And <hi>Lewis,</hi> ſon to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> was almoſt born, and dead in a moment. <hi>Kirchbaw</hi> an Emperian Major, being taken among the <hi>Swedes,</hi> was beheaded at <hi>Vienna</hi> in this year 1639; and within the compaſſe of the ſame year the Earl of <hi>Buchaim</hi> being mortally wounded in a ſporting-exerciſe, in a ſhort time after exchanged life for death. In 1640, beſides <hi>Amurath</hi> the Turk, dyed <hi>George Con,</hi> (one of the Pope's three Ambaſſadours, that (by the Queens prevalency with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> king her husband) had been lately ſent unto him, and with great honour received by him, in his return out of <hi>England</hi> to Rome. Alſo <hi>George Wilhelm,</hi> Duke Elector of <hi>Brandenburg;</hi> whom <hi>Frederick Wilhelm</hi> ſucceeded. Which <hi>Frederick</hi> the year following began to diminiſh the Emperour, by little and little, making his Garriſons his own, and therefore is honourably and bountifully received in the Aſſemblies at <hi>Warſove.</hi> But <hi>Chriſtian Ulrick,</hi> a Prince of <hi>Denmark,</hi> departing from <hi>Colone,</hi> a City on this ſide the River <hi>Rhene,</hi> by the hands of the provoked <hi>Hollanders</hi> (for this very year 1640, they were fordidden the Daniſh Sea) periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Likewiſe <hi>Otto,</hi> a ſingle man, Earl of <hi>Schaumburg,</hi> and the laſt of that Earldome. Amongſt the reſt <hi>Anthony Caraffa</hi> in the Province of <hi>Barryen,</hi> in the kingdome of <hi>Neapolis,</hi> is to be minded, who in 1641, for new burthens (a fair warning) impoſed on the people, was by the common people ſlain. And to conclude this Chapter with a moſt ſad accident that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the year 1640. At <hi>Forcheym</hi> of <hi>Francony,</hi> a Countreyman killing a Hog, went away about other occaſions; in whoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence two little Boyes, one of ſix, another of three years old, in imitation of their father, kill a little brother of theirs under three Moneths old; and as though they had well done, tell the horrid act to their father, being in the Garden. He beholding the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:33388:234"/>chides them with harſh words. Whereupon the children for fear of rods, hide the child in the oven. Their Mother, being about her work and knowing nothing, running from the cattle, ſets fire on dry wood to bake, and departs: when ſhe came to draw out the coals, ſhe ſeeth (as I may ſay) her own bowels in her childs, burned: which cauſed her to ruſh head-long into a Well and drown her ſelf; and her Husband (through this double grief) to hang himſelf.</p>

                        <hi>Torſthenſon</hi> therefore having taken on him <hi>Bannier</hi>'s truſt in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Swedes, playes <hi>Bannier</hi>'s part; for, having condemned one <hi>Seckendorf</hi> (a Commander) to be beheaded, for treachery to the Army at the ſiege of Wolfebyte; and by <hi>Koningſmark</hi> raiſed the ſiege of <hi>Mansfield;</hi> hearing that <hi>Stalhanſe</hi> was overcharged by the Duke of <hi>Lawenburg</hi> throughout Sileſia, he runs to him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reduced four places of ſtrength; in the moneth of June 1642, ſcatters the ſaid <hi>Lawenburg</hi> his forces, and at <hi>Swenice,</hi> takes him, with 38 Waggons. Thence (having fortified another place as a refuge in doubtfull caſes) he goeth to <hi>Sittave,</hi> and undertaking to beſiege Lipſie, the Emperians coming to oppoſe him, he goes to meet them, and gave them a great overthrow; there were ſlain to the number of 5000, he took 83 great and choyſe Officers pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and above 4000 and 400 common Souldiers, 122 Enſigns, 46 great guns, together with 69 Waggons: and when this was done, returns to <hi>Lipſie,</hi> and on the 24 of October the ſame year, receives it by ſurrender. And (that he might the better deal with the Emperour) perſwades the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> to ſtand as a neuter; but the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> not ſo.</p>

And, being now worſted, (through the labour and endeavour of the King of Denmark) toward the end of the year, he admits of a Treaty of peace with the Swedes; and to this end, are Aſſemblies gathered together at <hi>Frankford</hi> upon the River Mentz. Nevertheleſſe, the war going on, and being every where ſtrove againſt; not forgetting the ſlaughter and overthrow at <hi>Lipſia,</hi> he beheadeth in 1643 more of the chief, and authors of that flight, publiſhing his Brigades to be infamous. And for his aſſiſtance, would have drawn forth the <hi>Hungarians</hi> without their Kingdom's bounds, but could not obtain them.

And having firſt redeemed ſome Captains of three Legions (that were through ſloath ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by the enemy) with money, he afterward hangs ſome, and caſhiereth others. But beſieging <hi>Brunne,</hi> a ſtrong place, to his great dammage, he over-recruited the ſaid loſſe, by diſperſing <hi>Bucheym</hi> an Emperian Commander, and vanquiſhing <hi>Eulenburg,</hi> a Town (in the borders of <hi>Moravia</hi> and <hi>Sileſia</hi>) containing in it a million of gold.

But, there having been a letter not long before, of <hi>George Digbie</hi>'s, a Lord, unto the Queen, out of Zealand intercepted, in which he ſpake of the King's declaring himſelf, and retiring to ſome ſafe place, &amp;c. beſides other grounds, this Court ſuſpected his intentions, and appointed <hi>John Hotham,</hi> a Knight of that Countrey to prevent the King of taking that ſtrong hold with its ammunition, into his poſſeſſion.

<pb n="458" facs="tcp:33388:236"/>in arms, beſides ſome of the Nobility and Gentry, on the 23 day of the ſame moneth, to demand entrance into that Town; the ſaid <hi>Hotham</hi> denying him on his knees, upon the Town-wall, was proclaimed Traytor by the King: whoſe act nevertheleſſe the Parliament juſtified on the 25 day, and endeavoured to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the King, but in vain. For the King daily ſummoning by Proclamations both the chief and common ſort of thoſe parts, to attend him as a Guard for his Perſon, who (ſaid he) was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Parliament; (about which time alſo <hi>Thomas Roe</hi> Knight, was by him ſent over as an Embaſſadour to <hi>Vienna</hi> in Germany, to preſſe on the cauſe of the Palatinate,) the Parliament likewiſe declared, that ſuch arming of men in an extraordinary way, was againſt the Lawes and Kingdom's Liberties. And when about the latter end of this moneth of April, 1642, 36 Lords, as alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Commons houſe, within a moneths time, went from the Parliament unto the King at York; then the Kingdom in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall feared a Civill War, which before was by many ſuſpected; ſo that on the ſecond of July following, propoſitions being by that high Court, ſent unto the King for his conſent, and no conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made concerning them; It was ordered on June the 10th, by Parliament, That Money and Plate ſhould be brought in, either by gift or loan, which they profeſſed was to levy Forces for the maintaining the Proteſtant Religion, the King's Perſon, authority and dignity, the peace of the Kingdom, together with the Laws of the Land, and priviledges of the People's Repreſentative, the Parliament. The King alſo did the like, inviting people to the ſame thing in the ſame words. And (toward the latter end of June) his Great Seal being conveyed unto him from the Lord Keeper of it, <hi>Littleton,</hi> he iſſued forth Proclamations, one whereof was, That the Parliaments Warrants about ſettling the Militia in their hands ſhould not be obeyed. And they (on the contrary) forbade raiſing arms by the King's Warrant, without their authority. The King alſo having pawned the Jewels of his Crown for 200000 <abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling, (which his Queen had carried over into Holland, in the moneth of Febr. 1641, to that purpoſe, when ſhe went over with her daughter the Princeſs of Orange) at this time, received money, with Arms and Ammunition, ſo that now he ſent out Commiſſions of <hi>Array,</hi> for the arming men in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which Commiſſion was proclaimed in <hi>London,</hi> for which the Lord Mayor of that City was turned out, and diſabled of any Office, and committed priſoner to the Tower, July the 11th; and on the next day, the Earl of <hi>Eſsex</hi> was by the Parliament voted General of their Army. The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> alſo, skillfull in Sea-Affairs, was by their Ordinance choſen Admiral of the Navy, who a little after took a conſiderable ſhip coming out of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, laden with Gun-powder for the King's ſervice; which was not a ſmall addition to his Sea-ſtrength. The ſaid Earl of <hi>Eſsex</hi> raiſing an Army upon the Parliaments Vote, on the firſt of Auguſt following, began to divide his men into Regiments, which
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:33388:236"/>in a ſhort time amounted to nigh 14000 horſe and foot; when in the mean time, the King with 3000 foot, and 1000 horſemen on the 15th of July began to beſiege <hi>Hull;</hi> which ſiege (what by opening a ſluce, and drowning the Countrey thereabout, what by two ſallies made out of the Town, by one <hi>John Meldrum</hi> Knight; in the firſt of which, the beſiegers were made to retreat with ſome ſmall loſſe; and in the ſecond, after the ſtrengthening of the Town with more men, making them diſorderly to retire, with the ſlaughter of 21 perſons, and ſome taken priſoners, taking alſo the King's Ammunition, and firing the barn in which it was kept) was broken up. And now <hi>[furor arma miniſtrat]</hi> both ſides beginning to aſſault one another with fury, divers places began to be taken and retaken. Amongſt which, the ſtrong Sea-garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> was on Septemb. 7. 1642, ſurrendred to the Parliaments forces under the command of Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> Knight.</p>
                     <p>The King on the 22 of Auguſt the ſame year ſets up his Standard (which I may call an actual Marriage of that War, which was but before eſpouſed) and the third day after ſent to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to compoſe the difference between him and them by a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Of which that Court ſaid they were not in a condition to do, unleſſe the Standard were taken down and Proclamations (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were called Rebels and Traytors) were revoked. So that on the 9th of Septemb. General <hi>Eſsex</hi> departed from <hi>London</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Army, who expected his coming unto them to their Rendezvouz at <hi>North-hampton;</hi> Unto whom alſo the Parliament ſent a Petition, which he ſhould preſent unto the King, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf from thoſe perſons about him, &amp;c. But he was too far prejudiced to grant the ſame; the Biſhops, (to make the ſore the wider, whom he loved, and without whom, he thought he could be no King,) being on Septemb. 1. 1642, voted powerleſſe in Church-Government, who not long before had power both in Church and State. So, <hi>Eſsex</hi> attending the King's motion (after ſome skirmiſhes of parties) Octob. 23, on a Plain called, <hi>The Vale of Red-Horſe,</hi> ſituate at the foot of a ſteep Hill, called <hi>Edge-Hill,</hi> near to a Village called <hi>Keynton,</hi> in the County of Warwick, joyned the firſt pitched battle with the King's Army, (the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> being the king's General) his Army conſiſting of about 11000 horſe and foot. <hi>Eſsex</hi> (having, for haſte of following them, left no ſmall part of his forces and Artillery behind him) had ſcarce ſo many. This fight was bloudy and dubious; <hi>Robert</hi> the king's Couzen charging furiouſly on the Parliaments left wing, put both horſe and foot to flight, ſeizing on his enemies Carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and baggage. A valiant Knight on the other ſide, brake the foot of the King's left wing, and ſeized on his Artillery; the King's Standard was taken, but ſoon retaken: both ſides had Trophies of victory, Enſigns, priſoners, and great guns; ſo that neither party could much upbraid each other. Notwithſtanding, of the 5000 and upwards that were ſlain in all, more of the King's ſide
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:33388:237"/>were ſlain; and beſides, <hi>Lindſey</hi> his General was taken prifoner, and ſoon after dyed of wounds received.</p>
                     <p>The King, after the fight, marched to the City and Univerſity of Oxford; which place he took up, as it were, the Metropolis of his reſidence in the time of the War; and <hi>Eſsex</hi> unto Coventry for refreſhment, who came Novemb. 7. to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> his Army quartering in Villages adjacent, by reaſon of the King's wide ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions out of <hi>Oxford,</hi> which put <hi>London</hi> in fear. At which time, (while the Parliament was petitioning him for an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of peace, being but 15 miles from the City, and he had manifeſted a grief for the peoples ſufferings, with a deſire to treat with them near <hi>London</hi> upon Propoſitions) his forces fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly upon a Parliament broken Regiment at <hi>Brainford,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven miles diſtance, killing many, on the 12th day of November; and the next day there was a bloody fight maintained by two other Regiments coming for aſſiſtance. <hi>Eſex,</hi> ſoon hearing of it at <hi>London,</hi> came ſpeedily with ſtrength for relief, with a great number of armed men out of <hi>London;</hi> So that, had there not been an overſight committed, in withdrawing 3000 men from <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> a Town 10 miles off, the King (being by a far greater number encloſed) would ſcarce have eſcaped; the which now he did, ſafely returning to Oxford: But this action did not a little engage <hi>London</hi> againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt divers beſiegings, ſtormings, taking of places this year, that of <hi>Cyrenceſter,</hi> a Town of Glouceſterſhire, is remarkable, which being entred by the King's Forces, the reſiſters were very rigidly and too too cruelly dealt withall, many of them being brought (in the winter ſeaſon) from that place to Oxford thorow mire and dirt barefoot; this was in the beginning of February; On the 22d day of which moneth, the Queen of <hi>England</hi> landed at <hi>Burlington,</hi> a Sea-Town in Yorkſhire, with arms againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, whence ſhe went to York on March the 7th; and was by the Parliament voted a Traytor to the Common-wealth, May the 23d, 1643. A little after whoſe landing, March the ſecond, 1642, the Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> a Parliament Commander, who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted both valorous, learned, and virtuous, is by a Musket ſhot from the Minſter of <hi>Lichfield</hi> in Leiceſterſhire, ſtricken dead, as he looked out of a window toward the encloſed enemy, to the ſorrow and enragement of his Souldiery. About the middle of which moneth alſo, divers Capuchin-Fryers, that had before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed unto the Queen, were by order of the ſaid Parliament ſent away into <hi>France,</hi> from whence they came. And whereas now the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had begun to help the King, he is by the States of the United Provinces, either through good will, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy reſtrained.</p>
                     <p>But the year following 1643, (raging hatred and reſolution now ſtriving, as it were, to exceed) the kindled fire was broken forth into devouring flames in many or moſt Counties of the Land; ſo that I ſhall not undertake here particularly to view the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:33388:237"/>variety and multiplicity of actions, ſome following years in <hi>Brittain,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>England;</hi> but ſhall confine my ſelf unto ſome few moſt remarkable things. Yet this I ſay, There were very few Wars in the World ever carried on with more vigour, enmity, and deſire of conqueſt, than this, for the time: but, the greateſt ſtorms being uſually ſooneſt over, makes that naturall Axiome true in a moral ſenſe,
<q>
                           <l>Nullum violentum eſt perpetuum,</l>
                           <l>No violent thing (but comes with blaſting)</l>
                           <l>Yet it is not alway laſting.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Summer, the chief time for action, the Parliament went down the wind; for <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> with his ſon, was routed by the Earl of New-caſtle on Barmtham Moor, March 29, 1643, and then by him beſieged in <hi>Hull.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Eſsex</hi> indeed beſieging <hi>Reading,</hi> April 16, had it ſurrendred unto him within 12 dayes after. But his Army, after that, what by reaſon of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, what through want of neceſſaries, for which many forſook their Colours, himſelf was forced to retreat to <hi>London,</hi> waiting for a recruit. About which time alſo, Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> Knight (beſieging the Town of <hi>Devizes</hi> Weſtward, where the beſieged were put to hard ſhifts) was by a party of the King's from Oxford, through viciſſitude of fortune in July, totally defeated; and loſing his Army, came to <hi>London</hi> alſo; whereupon the City of <hi>Briſtol</hi> was on the 24th day of the ſame moneth beſieged by the King, and within four dayes time yielded up unto him, (which ſudden ſurrender, many imputed unto the ſoftneſſe of the Governour's ſpirit) ſtrong holds now falling into the hands of his forces, as it were untimely fruit, or leafs ſhaken with the wind. <hi>Exeter,</hi> a ſtrong City in the Weſt, was begirt by Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> which was taken Sept. 3. following: Onely <hi>Glouceſter</hi> (in which the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Maſsey</hi>'s courage and reſolution was famous) ſtood out nigh a moneths ſpace, ſtraightly beſieged, and furiouſly aſſaulted, yet unconquered: the ſucceſſefull King, through his over much emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſſe of ſubduing that place, neglected (like <hi>Hannibal</hi> of old) to improve his victories to the beſt advantage, who (in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood) if he had then come for <hi>London,</hi> might have been maſter of it; untill, <hi>Eſsex</hi> being well recruited, came, at the laſt pinch, for that Citie's relief, which was on September the 8th, fighting the King's Army on the 20th day in a ſet-battel at Newberry in Barkſhire, where they were vanquiſhed; and ſo the Parliaments ſtrength revived, and came even to an equal weight, who before were very much over-ballanced.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament wanting money to maintain their Armies, an Exciſe on Victual, and divers Commodities, was thought of, at the very beginning of the year, March 28, the firſt mover being Mr. <hi>William Pryn,</hi> one of the three Sufferers; which Exciſe, ſome
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:33388:238"/>in deteſtation, called the <hi>Dutch-Devil,</hi> becauſe it was an imitation of that people, and lay heavy upon the poorer ſort. It was ſettled by Ordinance, July 18 following.</p>
                     <p>This was the time alſo wherein a joynt Covenant was entred into by the Engliſh with the Scots, called a ſolemn vow and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, one main head (as to maintain the King's Perſon and juſt dignity, whereof was, to endeavour the bringing of the three Nations into one-neſſe of conformity in Religion and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip according to the Word of God: which clauſe, <hi>Word of God,</hi> being afterwards thought of by many, gave them (in their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions) a liberty of diſſenting from any conformity, that they judged not agreeable thereto. Which Covenant, the Parliament (as an example to the reſt) took, June 6. 1643.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time there was a ſad deſign againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and City of <hi>London</hi> diſcovered, which was for armed men to ariſe, killing and ſlaying, while the City was in divers places burning; for the which, two chiefly ſuffered death before their own doors, <hi>Thompkins,</hi> who had ſome relation to the Queen; and <hi>Challenour,</hi> a Citizen, on July the 5th. The books of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being given unto another Doctor who was their friend, by the Parliament, Octob. 3. who alſo in the moneth November, had a new Great Seal made; againſt which, the King (the ſame November 21,) openly declared.</p>
                     <p>The Biſhop of Rome (who had excommunicated the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> whereupon he renounced the Protection of <hi>France</hi> in 1641) having fallen out with him, treats of a peace with the ſaid Duke in 1642; in which year alſo Rome is fortified, becauſe they there feared the weapons of their Spaniſh Catholique King, who was offended with the Pope, for entertaining a <hi>Portugal</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. But the year following, the Biſhop and the Duke (not agreeing) wage a hot war; he demanding ayds (as his due) from the Viceroy of Naples, arming alſo the Princes of Italy againſt the Duke. And would have had <hi>Piccolominie</hi> for his General, but could not obtain him. But the <hi>Florentines</hi> this year, give him an overthrow, killing one thouſand of his Souldiers, and taking an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, with all his warlike proviſion: notwithſtanding, within a little time, he revengeth himſelf upon him. So he that kills with the ſword, ſhall be killed with the ſword; Yet this did not <hi>Peter.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi> in 1642, affect one onother with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall overthrows, although the <hi>French</hi> exceed. The one in <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> overcommeth the ſon of the Duke of <hi>Lordon</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, ſlaying 3000, taking many, and but few eſcaping; fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alſo among ſome of the prey, 60000 double Crowns. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> alſo conquers the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Caſtellatum,</hi> killing 3000 and ſix hundred, 3000 and 400 being taken. He recovered the Town <hi>Baſsaea.</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> take from him <hi>Colibria</hi> and <hi>Argiller</hi> in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> beſieging <hi>Perpinian,</hi> and by the extreameſt hunger tames it, avoiding the treachery, and layings in wait of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in which ſiege, 300 perſons yielded to the hungry for the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:33388:238"/>ſupport of life; diſperſing alſo the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who by night ſet upon <hi>Excluſana.</hi> He obtains likewiſe this year, ſome Victory both by Sea and land at <hi>Barcellona;</hi> by land, ſnatching withall the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies victual; by Sea, in a Sea-fight, though not without loſſe to himſelf, ſubduing two ſtrong holds in Italy this year, and in 1643, as many; lengthening his league with the <hi>Swede</hi> for three years longer. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> indeed makes <hi>Tortone</hi> yield to him this year 1643. As alſo vanquiſheth <hi>Monſone</hi> in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving moſt rich ſhips out of the Indies. But the <hi>French</hi>-man van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſheth the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>Rocroy,</hi> where there was much bloud ſpilt, 12000 being ſlain on both ſides; ſo that, although the <hi>French</hi> had the day, taking many of the Conquered (which Captives they redeemed with 22000, 288 <hi>Florenes,</hi> as before 800 priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of war at <hi>Antwerp</hi> for 50000 <hi>Florenes</hi>) and 180 Enſigns, all their Guns, bag and baggage; yet they might ſay with <hi>Livy</hi> the Hiſtorian concerning a <hi>Roman</hi> Victory.</p>

<pb n="464" facs="tcp:33388:239"/>before, were deſignes againſt the Governour, as was but now ſaid) And who not long before, bruiſed (though but lightly) his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and leg, being ſhaken off his Horſe, by a wild Boar overtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him. He likewiſe commands <hi>Galaſse,</hi> a chieftain of his, to bring aid to the King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> the ſame <hi>Galaſse</hi> takes quickly the Caſtle of <hi>Zeize,</hi> ſending away the Souldiery by virtue of the Emperours Oath or promiſe made unto them; and fighting with the <hi>Swedes</hi> at <hi>Odesloe,</hi> there was little noiſe of that conflict.

And comming for relief to <hi>Eiſlebe</hi> that was beſieged, <hi>Galaſse</hi> ſlips away, but other 2000 of his purveyors are beaten by him, with the Garriſon Souldiers, he purſueth the Victory, following after <hi>Galaſse's</hi> laſt troop, the which he chaſeth with <hi>Enkefort</hi> that was their leader, and takes the ſaid <hi>Enkefort</hi> in the narrow paſſages lying between <hi>Magdeburg</hi> and <hi>Witteberg.</hi> Then by a fearfull aſſault, he winneth <hi>Pegave;</hi> and prevailing over the Caſtle of <hi>Zeize,</hi> that <hi>Galaſse</hi> had but even now taken, he demoliſheth it, and then like a carefull Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, refreſheth his ſouldiers, who were almoſt tired with theſe toils. <hi>Koningſmart</hi> (in the mean time) is buſied in gathering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions on every ſide; who poſſeſſeth and deſtroyeth the Town of <hi>Langwele,</hi> that was ſubdued by the Archbiſhops Army.

But <hi>Wrangel</hi> taketh three ſtrong holds, under whoſe conduct, alſo the ſiege of <hi>Pinneburg</hi> (above-mentioned) was quit.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, although <hi>Torſtenſon</hi> fought this year againſt the <hi>Dane,</hi> with equall ſucceſſe of Victory, yet <hi>Horn,</hi> with the Army that the year before he led out of <hi>Swethland,</hi> invading <hi>Scandia,</hi> and the <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi> (who was alſo engaged againſt him) entring <hi>Norway;</hi> could not but much moleſt him.

And although the <hi>Fleming</hi> gave place unto a greater number of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> troops this year then he had, yet it was celebrated by him with much bloud. The <hi>Swedes</hi> and he have a treble Sea-fight alſo; the firſt was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to either, the ſecond was more acceptable to the <hi>Swedes:</hi> and the third moſt acceptable unto them, diſperſing therein the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Fleet, whoſe King committing himſelf in perſon to his Sea, is this year wounded. Who likewiſe recovered <hi>Breydenburg</hi> from the <hi>Swedes</hi> by land; and turns them out of the Caſtles of <hi>Ripe</hi> and <hi>Haderſlebe,</hi> places within his command that they Garriſonned. And further, being offended with one <hi>Peter</hi> a <hi>French</hi>-man, his Vice-Admiral, for ſuffering the enemy to ſlip out of the <hi>Chelonian</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where he had him at an advantage, he cuts off his head. He
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:33388:239"/>diſmiſſeth the Emperours Captain (willingly enough) his aids afforded, being too chargeable and ſlow in comming; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone, he finds it enough to do, to extirpate the Swediſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders that had taken root in his Countrey.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, his ſon <hi>Voldamar,</hi> who is received by the white <hi>Ruſſians</hi> or <hi>Muſcovites</hi> (this year 1644) in a ſtately manner, as him that was to be the ſon in Law, and heir of their Prince; When he refuſed to take on him their Mungrell-Religion, (there being not envy wanting to ſpurre it on) he is leſſe trimly obſerved, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confined from his liberty in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> (whether that were the ſole cauſe of it, I know not) untill the Great Duke cloſed his laſt day, he neither by the craft or force of the <hi>Polanders,</hi> nor by the earneſt intreaty of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> his father, in 1644. could obtain the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Much was the action both in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> and not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in ſome other places, in the year 1645. For the Emperour who had to deal with, as alſo fearing, an unwearied enemy, the <hi>Swede;</hi> having received unto him his Army (out of <hi>Holſatia</hi>) that was ſhattered, and greatly leſſened, muſters a new Army; and that he might have proſperous ſucceſſe, appoints publick prayers to be made in his behalf, and withall, goeth to <hi>Brandiſe</hi> unto the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which was there ſet in its firſt ſtate, for he had redeemed it out of the hands of the <hi>Swedes</hi> for 10000 Florenes. Nevertheleſſe <hi>Torſtenſon</hi> (who thought to be at hand with the Emperour before he ſhould renew his Army) when he had in his march waſted <hi>Bruxy</hi> with fire, paſſing thorow <hi>Ottove,</hi> and <hi>Moldavia,</hi> ſtops at <hi>Jancoa,</hi> which place was between him and the Emperians, and for want of room, poſſeſſing a hill, he fights moſt ſtifly with <hi>Goce</hi> (who was chief Commander for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) for eight hours ſpace (this battell was on the twenty fourth of February, 1645) and he vanquiſheth the ſaid <hi>Goce</hi> his Army, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from the Emperour 289 Officers of note, even to the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peters, 4000 common ſouldiers were taken, beſides 45 Wagons, 32 Enſignes, 26 Engines; with the loſſe of five Captains. Theſe leaders of his thus taken, he redeems out of <hi>Torſtenſons</hi> hands with 80000 Royals, and ſo by force requires tribute from the people for this purpoſe. The Conquerour after this is not idle, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed 2000 of many ſorts or companies, that had gatherred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together after this rout, and beſides, freeing <hi>Olmuce</hi> a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon that the enemy had poſſeſſed, he forced in eight or nine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable places, even to <hi>Vienna</hi> the Emperour's place of reſidence, ſo that that City it ſelf was miſtruſted: but that he might not too much triumph in ſucceſſe, he beſiegeth <hi>Brunne</hi> in vain, with the great dammage of his foot ſouldiery; yet the occaſion of deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſiege, was from one <hi>Gerſdorf,</hi> being intercepted with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great moment in <hi>Sileſia;</hi> ſo that having fortified the Town of <hi>Cornuburg,</hi> he viſiteth <hi>Moravia,</hi> and ſtraight way after <hi>Bohemia,</hi> where he wipes their noſe both of Gold and Bread-Corn, which being ſent before into <hi>Sileſia,</hi> he followeth; then vanquiſheth
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:33388:240"/>other places, he puts the City <hi>Prague</hi> into a fright; and paſſing over the River <hi>Albis</hi> that was frozen up with cold, he haſtneth to win <hi>Tetchine</hi> Caſtle by aſſault; but being ſick of the Gout, he is brought to <hi>Lypſye;</hi> committing unto <hi>Wrangle</hi> the whole charge of his office: who had <hi>Bruxia</hi> now yielded up unto him, which <hi>Torſtenſon,</hi> had hurt by fire before, as aboveſaid.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour alſo this year, being an enemy unto <hi>Ragotzy</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> ſends <hi>Bucheym</hi> a chieftain to oppoſe him, which <hi>Tranſilvanian, Torſtenſon</hi> was buſied in, infolding a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual War, as we may judge, to keep (ſuch is the Policy of Warlike enemies) the Emperour the more in action; yet he comes to an agreement this year with the ſaid <hi>Ragotzy,</hi> ſending <hi>Bucheyme</hi> with ſix thouſand men, and furniture to aid the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> who was in danger, ſtriving alſo what he could to drive the <hi>Swedes</hi> out of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> whoſe Camps, (through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fierceneſſe of the cold) were (at <hi>Glactove</hi>) in the latter end of the year, pitched one againſt the other for lodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> is this year beaten by <hi>Wrangle</hi> before he undertook <hi>Torſtenſons</hi> truſt; expecting nothing but war with the <hi>Dutch:</hi> He loſt alſo a great Ship called the <hi>Sophia</hi> by Shipwrack, that his mother had beautified with the Charge of 120000 Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, carrying ſixty four pieces of Ordinance; and although he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered <hi>Bremeroverd</hi> by craft, and took priſoner the Governour of <hi>Wartisberg,</hi> with a company of 800 Collectours of money. Yet at length (fortune having forſaken him) and being bent thereto through the intreaties of his States, after a Negotiation ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly long, he enters a peace both with the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> through the vehement labour of the <hi>French</hi> King therein.</p>
                     <p>Whiles <hi>Wrangle</hi> was afflicting the <hi>Dane</hi> throughout Holſatia, <hi>Koningſmark</hi> ſubdueth the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Bremes,</hi> vanquiſhing five ſtrong holds there: then joyning their Forces together, they deſtroy <hi>Buchwald</hi> the Emperian, with a great ſlaughter. And about the middle of this Summer, <hi>Wrangle</hi> himſelf overcomes an Iſland, called the Iſle of <hi>Bornholm, Koningſmark</hi> departing from him into Haſſia, that he might repair the French, that had been under <hi>Vinurn,</hi> who were beaten by <hi>Werth,</hi> the General of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varians, at <hi>Mergentheym;</hi> Where, the <hi>Vinurn-French, Koningſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, Geece,</hi> and the General of the Haſſians, joyning in one, they drive the <hi>Bavarians</hi> from <hi>Kirchain,</hi> and croſſing the River <hi>Rhene,</hi> they win three places by aſſault, overflowing the Valley <hi>Tauber:</hi> and then <hi>Koningſmark</hi> being called back into <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> adding by a ſupply of ſtrength, courage unto them, they fight moſt ſharply July 24, at Alberſheyme; in which conflict, the right Wing, in which the <hi>French</hi> were placed, is diſperſed; bet the left Wing, in which the valour of the <hi>Haſsians</hi> chiefly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, overcame; <hi>Geleene</hi> was here taken, and <hi>Merce</hi> ſlain, to the grief of the conquered. And then gathering themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from the chaſe, they drive the <hi>Bavarians</hi> over the River <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubius.</hi>
                        <pb n="467" facs="tcp:33388:240"/>Hereupon two Garriſons, <hi>Nordlinge</hi> and <hi>Dunkelspule,</hi> are made the Conquerour's, <hi>Hailbrunne</hi> being beſieged, but left, when as the Emperour had ſent the Bavarian large aſſiſtance by <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheyme</hi> aforeſaid, that they might make them ruſh, as it were, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, leaving their greater guns behind them, toward <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</hi> Then the <hi>Bavarian</hi> recovered three places, whereof <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelspule</hi> is one. <hi>Koningſmark</hi> having (before this battle) taken three ſtrong holds in <hi>Saxony,</hi> and brought the Electour thereof unto a truce for ſix moneths. By all which may be gathered, what ground the Emperour loſt this year.</p>
                     <p>Some other things were done, as <hi>Bugsdorff,</hi> poſſeſſing himſelf of <hi>Hornburg,</hi> and another place, &amp;c. But I ſhall ſtop here with <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> for this year, when I have added theſe two things, That <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> of <hi>Bade</hi> undergoeth the protection of France, <hi>Halle</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a garriſon of Swedes into it for defence. And <hi>Maurice</hi> of Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw is returned from exile out of <hi>Sigeum,</hi> a Town and Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory near <hi>Troy,</hi> unto his own Countrey.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Brittain,</hi> the Engliſh Parliament ſeeing a need of aſſiſtance from their Neighbour-Nation the Scots, in 1643, and ſending Commiſſioners to <hi>Edinburg</hi> for the drawing of them into <hi>England;</hi> upon condition of a joynt-taking the Covenant aforeſaid, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them 100000 <abbr>l.</abbr> towards raiſing the Army, promiſed them 21000 horſe and foot. Which accordingly, either about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of January, or the beginning of March the ſame year, paſſed over the River <hi>Tyne,</hi> and came in; when as now, as I have ſaid, the Parliament were in an indifferent equality of ſtrength by their own Armies.</p>
                     <p>The King alſo, not to be wanting in the like kind of endeavour, grants a Ceſſation of arms unto the Rebellious in Ireland, (the which was made Septemb. 15. 1643.) whereby he might have Forces out of Ireland for his help: and it being at that time not a diſcommodity, but a benefit unto them, the King received a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſum of money from them for it, to wit, 30000 <abbr>l.</abbr> (which Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation being againſt the Parliaments Act formerly ſigned unto by him, was much ſpoken againſt by many). The landing of which Iriſh forces in behalf of the King, being Novemb. 19 following at <hi>Moſton,</hi> was two or three moneths before the Scots coming in behalf of the Parliament, in execution; although the other might be firſt in reſolution.</p>
                     <p>Neither were theſe mutuall aids alike proſperous; for they that had victoriouſly fought againſt thoſe that Rebelled in <hi>Ireland,</hi> now fighting againſt the Parliament, being but a little while at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, were quite broken by forces under the command of Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> moſt or all their principall commanders, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with 1700 Common ſouldiers being taken; when as it was not ſo with the Scottiſh Army. Who under the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> their Generall, marching againſt the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> who had a great Army for the King in the North, took ſome ſtrong holds, and (though there was ſome heat of fighting) by enduring the great
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:33388:241"/>cold and hardneſſe of weather at that ſeaſon, weakned and leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſaid <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> Army. And in the year 1644. two other Generalls, Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> (where that ſtout, and I may ſay, Iron ſouldier <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> commanded) and Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> after their ſeveral ſervices, joyning with the Scottiſh General, they went all together with concord (by the which, as <hi>Maſiniſsa</hi> King of <hi>Numidia</hi> ſaid to his ſons, dying; <hi>Resparvae creſcunt, Small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters gather ſtrength, and increaſe</hi>) and then beſieged <hi>York,</hi> the ſecond chief City in <hi>England,</hi> in which the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> himſelf was incloſed; which place being of great moment, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> the Kings Couſin came with great forces to relieve; whereby the three Generalls being engaged to draw off, the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> having freedome to bring his forces out of <hi>York,</hi> joyned with <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert,</hi> and ſo on a place called <hi>Marſton Moor</hi> adjoyning, July the ſecond 1644. was fought the greateſt battell of that Civil war. In which battel, although (through ſome diſadvantage of ground) the Parliaments right wing was put to flight; yet <hi>Cromwell</hi> brake by a furious force the right wing of the King's, and put them to flight, and with <hi>Leſley</hi> the Scottiſh Lievtenant-General, purſued in chaſe. <hi>Cromwell</hi> alſo coming about again with his horſemen, and relieving the other wing, whereby at length a full Victory was gotten, and all <hi>Ruperts</hi> great Guns, Carriages, Bag and Baggage, with above a hundred Enſigns, were in the Conquerours poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Who returned unto the ſiege of <hi>York,</hi> and ſoon had it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred unto them upon conditions, <hi>Rupert</hi> being before gone or rather fled into the South, and the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> paſſing into <hi>Germany. Leven,</hi> (the forces being parted aſſunder) a while after, taking (by his Scots) the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> farther North, which by reaſon of the trade of Sea-col chiefly, is eſteemed rich.</p>
                     <p>But although (by reaſon of divers, and not ſmall Armies that were raiſed on both ſides at the Spring of this year 1644, under ſeveral valiant Commanders, and their almoſt equal ſucceſſe,) <hi>England</hi> ſeemed to be unhappy, yet about the latter end of the Summer, there was (as it were) a retaliation of this Northern Conqueſt, by the defeating the Parliaments General, <hi>Eſsex,</hi> in the Weſt of the Land, (beſides the prevailing of the King's Forces over the Parliaments, in the Southern and Midland parts,) who with Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> having begun to beſiege or block up <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> on both ſides, the King eſcaping with a few horſe out of the City, that deſign was left off; and (<hi>Waller</hi> not being with him, but dividing their forces on May the 29th) the ſaid General <hi>Eſsex</hi> marched into the Weſt, even as far as <hi>Cornwall,</hi> (when at <hi>Burford,</hi> he had appointed <hi>Waller</hi> to purſue the King on June the 6th, who had marched with his Army towards <hi>Worceſter</hi> from <hi>Oxford,</hi> June the third, who could not hinder the King of his deſign, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to encounter other forces;) where being environed, by the King's Army that came upon them (in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the fartheſt County Weſtward) he was diſperſed, his whole
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:33388:241"/>Infantry or foot ſubmitting to the King, the horſe eſcaping as well as they could, the Earl himſelf fleeing to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> Septemb. 1. whoſe Souldiers alſo through the enmity of the Inhabitants unto the Parliaments cauſe, ſuffered injuries. After this, he being again recruited, on Octob. 27. following, there was a ſecond bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel fought near <hi>Newberry</hi> in Berkſhire, where although there were loſſes on both ſides, yet no great cauſe of triumph there was to either.</p>
                     <p>The Queen in the moneth of April 1644, journeying Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, came to <hi>Exeter,</hi> where June the 16th, ſhe was delivered of a daughter Princeſs <hi>Henrietta,</hi> and the 15th of the next moneth July, ſhe arrived at the Sea-Port Town of <hi>Breſt</hi> in <hi>Britany,</hi> a Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>France.</hi> Who went over, to uſe (though fruitleſſe) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for ayd from the French King and the Catholiques; and ſome ſay, that Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> was a great hinderer of <hi>French</hi> ayds againſt the Parliament. Likewiſe after much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> gave King <hi>Charls</hi> hope of 10000 men, of thoſe that he for ſome years had taken the Emperour's part with, againſt the <hi>Swede</hi> and the <hi>French.</hi> But although there were a Negotiatour ſent into <hi>Holland</hi> about the buſineſs, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance; yet they never ſet footing in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the ſame time alſo the King ſought aſſiſtance from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels of <hi>Ireland,</hi> giving the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> the Lievtenant, power to make peace with them, as well as a Ceſſation before made; (aſſuring them both of the free exerciſe of their Religion, and, when his War was ended, of an abrogation of all Laws made againſt Papiſts there,) which he wiſhed them to haſten, for reaſons in a Letter to <hi>Ormond.</hi> But when their demands were ſo high, that in many Treaties with them <hi>Ormond</hi> could effect nothing, He fully impowreth the Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> whom he had made Earl of <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgan,</hi> being a ſtrict Papiſt, to make peace with them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge them, with as much ſecreſie as might be: which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed for a time both from <hi>Ormond,</hi> and Lord <hi>Digby</hi> the Secretary: which politique and cunning working afterwards between <hi>Digby</hi> and <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> for fear of reflecting upon the King, who would not be ſeen to treat and make peace with them by a Papiſt; and alſo of diſpleaſing the Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland:</hi> having a doubt, in the mean time, leſt they ſhould offend the Iriſh Rebels, eſpecially ſeeing all thoſe devices for bringing an Army of thoſe Iriſh into <hi>England,</hi> were fruſtrated, I ſhall forbear any further to mention.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt all which miſeries and doubtfull events of War this year 1644, Propoſitions being ſent to Oxford in the moneth of November, the King and the Parliament came to a Treaty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning three particulars; Of their Church-Government and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; of the Militia or ſtanding Holds and Magazine of <hi>England;</hi> and about proſecuting the war of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where there had been nigh a year and half Ceſſation of arms. It began on Januar. 30 this year, by Commiſſioners from both, beſides Commiſſioners from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and continued a little above three weeks, until Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:33388:242"/>22. None of the three being conſented unto by the King, but the iſſue of war was left to decide all.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament therefore, who, after debate between the Lords and Commons, wherein the Lords at firſt diſſented, on Decem. 31 foregoing, had voted Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> ſon of the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> ſole General of their Armies, who was highly eſteemed both for Valour and Modeſty. Which change, the emulation of great Commanders partly occaſioned, whereby ſome good deſigns had not proſpered; and the Earl of <hi>Eſsex,</hi> with two other Earls by Land, and the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> by Sea, giving up their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; modelled a new Army, conſiſting of 21000 horſe and foot. In which were many Colonels and Officers of full bent and active reſolution to go thorow the buſineſſe of War, that they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. The King alſo not wanting divers Commanders, and great forces under them which poſſeſſed their ſeveral Coaſts, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrong Garriſons that were in his hands. But before I ſpeak of the atchievements of that <hi>Fairfaxian</hi> Army, which were great and manifold in the year 1645, I ſhall take notice of ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable things in 1644. Which were, (beſides divers Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours that came from <hi>France,</hi> from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi> to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Oxford,</hi> in 1643, and 1644, to mediate between the King and Parliament; which all took no effect; and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners from the Iriſh Proteſtants to <hi>Oxford,</hi> Novem. 23. 1644; as alſo Commiſſioners from the Romaniſts in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Decemb. 3. following,) of a great fire that happened in the moneth October this year in <hi>Oxford,</hi> burning down a great deal of building from <hi>Carphux</hi> toward the Caſtle Yard. Of three Suns or <hi>Par-helii</hi> that were ſeen in <hi>London,</hi> Novemb. 19. two being made by the image or likeneſſe of the One Sun, in a thick and even, quiet and watery cloud, lively ſet forth through the breaking in of the Sun beams. In which year alſo the two <hi>Hothams,</hi> father and ſon, who had Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the 15th, 1643, been brought priſoners out of the North to <hi>London,</hi> for conſpiracy to betray <hi>Hull</hi> to the King, breaking their truſt, &amp;c. were on the very Kalends of January, 1644, beheaded. (A ſad diſaſter, ſhewing, 'tis better never to engage in any thing, than not to be conſtant to what is undertaken.) On the third day of which January, the Common-Prayer-book (which before (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Croſſes and Images, in which number Cheap-ſide Croſſe was demoliſhed) Cathedral Service and Organs, &amp;c. had been in moſt places taken away by Army-force, and Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary-permiſſion) yieldeth unto a Directory, made by an Aſſembly or Synod at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which was eſtabliſhed in its room, by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-ordination. Within eight dayes after which, as though it had been on purpoſe, The Archbiſhop, <hi>William Laud,</hi> after al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt four years impriſonment in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> was ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the Ax for Crimes of a various kind; who ſeemed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf with confidence at the place of his execution, taking that place of Scripture, as a ſubject to ſpeak on to the people, <hi>Let us run with patience the race that is ſet before us.</hi> The which matter he
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:33388:242"/>did read unto them; the which was printed. Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> alſo the ſuffering-Miniſter under him, ſoon after, ſetting forth ſomething as to ſhew the falſe application of the ſame Scripture unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Likewiſe the Anti-Parliament, which were the Members that went from <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> who had aſſembled as a Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> Jan. 22. 1643, were adjourned for ſeven moneths, from March the 10th 1644, till Octob. 10th, 1645; whom alſo the King himſelf in a Letter to his Queen in <hi>France,</hi> called a <hi>Mungrel Parliament.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Charls</hi> alſo, Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> in the ſame moneth of March, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting into <hi>France.</hi> And (as though they would now make their King a Delinquent, the Commons houſe, on the 24th day of this moneth, as a concluſion of the year, voted, That that clauſe <hi>[For preſervation of his Majeſties Perſon]</hi> which was before in <hi>Eſsex</hi>'s, ſhould be left out in their new General's Commiſſion.</p>
                     <p>Who now being in a fit and ſtrong poſture, (although not ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, either in the honourable worthineſſe of Commanders, or in the experienced antiquity of the Souldiers,) one of the firſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes that was undertaken by this new-modelled Army, was to beſiege <hi>Oxford,</hi> which began on <hi>May</hi> 22, 1645; (the King about 15 dayes before marching out of the ſame, who being joyned with his two Couſins, <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Maurice,</hi> amongſt other intended de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, in the mean time beſieged <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> May 30, and the day following took it by ſtorming; which place was conſiderable in regard of ſtrength and ſituation,) <hi>Cromwell, Fairfax</hi> his Lievtenant General, above a month before doing ſome execution on a party of the Kings, at a place called <hi>Iſlip-bridge,</hi> beſieging alſo <hi>Blechington</hi> houſe, a Garriſon, whither ſome of them had fled, and had it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred unto him April 24; for which the Governor Colonel <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debank</hi> was the next day ſhot to death. While <hi>Oxford</hi> was beſieged, there was an eminent ſalley made by the encloſed, which gave ſome affront to the beſiegers, June the 2d; and within a few dayes after, General <hi>Fairfax</hi> raiſed his ſiege, time having been loſt by that unſeaſonable undertaking.</p>
                     <p>Time now drew nigh for a pitch'd battle, the which in <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamptonſhire,</hi> in the fields of <hi>Naſeby,</hi> was on the 14th day of the ſame June, joyned; many (as well they might) calling it, <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall battle of Naſeby;</hi> becauſe (like the Vertical point in the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack) it made the King's ſucceſſes, which were now raiſed high, to go, from that day, retrograde, and decay. In this fight, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at the firſt, through the routing of the left Wing of the <hi>Fairfaxians,</hi> and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>'s purſuit thereof, the day of victory ſeemed to ſhine upon the King's Army; (For they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtronger in horſe) yet <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s force doing the like to the Royaliſts, together with Major General <hi>Skippon</hi>'s magnanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe amongſt his foot, though much wounded, brought a night upon the former likelihoods; and gave both an abſolute and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py victory to the Parliament: The horſe fleeing to the late taken Garriſon of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> by <hi>Cromwell's</hi> purſuit, no ſmall number were
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:33388:243"/>taken priſoners; the Footmen (in general) deſiring quarter for their lives, having firſt thrown down their Arms, were to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of four or five thouſand brought priſoners to <hi>London.</hi> Trophies alſo of this Conqueſt were the King's Standard of War, with 100 Colours, beſides the King's Coach, with his Letters of Secreſie; all their great Guns, bag and baggage, rich pillage, with much gold and ſilver; and (which made it more acceptable) it was, though not <hi>[ſine ſudore]</hi> without pains; yet <hi>[ſine multo ſanguine]</hi> it coſt not much bloud, hardly 500 being ſlain in all; whereof almoſt 400 were of the conquered. <hi>Leiceſter</hi> hereupon (as <hi>York</hi> before, upon the like dyſaſter) quickly yielding to this conquering Army. The which by diligence and courage, without delay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated remaining Forces, relieved <hi>Taunton,</hi> took ſtrong holds and Garriſons, faſter than ever the other party had taken them before; amongſt which, that tough and ſtrong garriſon of <hi>Baſing</hi>-houſe, belonging to the Marqueſs of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and by him defended, (that had been more than once attempted, but in vain, and with the loſſe of many lives, was on Septemb. 14 this year 1645, taken (under the Command of Lievtenant General <hi>Cromwell</hi>) by ſtorm, in which the Marqueſſe himſelf was a Priſoner, and one <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min Johnſon,</hi> a notable Stage-Player formerly at <hi>London,</hi> amongſt the after-heat of the ſtormers, was by ſome Souldier ſlain.</p>
                     <p>The ſurprizal alſo of <hi>Hereford</hi> by Colonel <hi>Birch</hi> his ſtratagem, is remarkable, who under ſhew of bringing in Pioneers out of the Country in the night; the which the defendants for the King, had ſent for, to ſtrengthen their works, had the Draw-bridge pulled up unto a bold Souldier (with his company) that pretended the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables Office, who ſtoutly kept up the bridge from being put down, untill the watchful approaching Souldiers came in, and with no ſmall hurly-burly poſſeſſed that ſtrong City. It happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Decemb. 17th following, and amongſt divers Sea tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, five ſhips this year were taken by the Parliament at Sea, one whereof carried an Apoſtolique Meſſenger, ſo called, with 180000 Piſtolets.</p>
                     <p>The King now ſeeing unto what paſſe things were brought, and bringing againſt him, deſired to treat in perſon with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Jan. 13, which was denyed by them, chiefly (I underſtand) for fear leſt his Perſonal preſence in <hi>London,</hi> (where were a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude affecting both his Cauſe and Perſon) ſhould either cauſe diſturbance, or incurr danger. They having alſo perceived from his letters that were taken in the aforeſaid fight at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> which had been publiquely read in <hi>London,</hi> as divers things, ſo, that he treated not with them at <hi>Uxbridge</hi> out of a candid mind, neither would he willingly have given the name of a Parliament unto them; ſaying, <hi>It was one thing to call them ſo, and another thing ſo to acknowledg them.</hi> After which refuſal of the Parliament to treat, amongſt the reſt, <hi>Weſt-Cheſter</hi> (which the King was very loath to part with, it being ſo convenient a landing place from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and would fain have had <hi>Iriſh</hi> to relieve it,) was in February ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:33388:243"/>And at the cloſure of this year 1645, the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> on conditions granted him by General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> who had marched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Weſt parts, (which <hi>Hopton,</hi> had about the beginning of the War divers encounters with Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and was worſted by him, who was ſtill on his legs, and did great and long ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the King) ſuffered all his forces to be disbanded, March the 14th.</p>

Who receiving about 1200 of the Rebellious in Ireland, with others added to them in Scotland, for almoſt a year and an halfs ſpace, untill the battle of <hi>Kilſieth,</hi> by excurſions, and retreats into craggy and difficult pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, getting one Victory, and loſing two, lay like a gawling ſore, or peſtilentious diſeaſe in his Countrey. On whoſe ſucceſſe the King having no ſmall reliance, earneſtly attempted to joyn, but could by no means accompliſh it, being hindred by Parliament Commanders. (The Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the mean time, having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a ſerious admonition unto the King, ſhewing the danger of thoſe courſes; which he little or nothing regarded;) Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, <hi>Montroſſe,</hi> ſuddenly appearing, with ſcarce 4000, out of his rediring places, Aug. 17. 1645, in <hi>Kilſieth</hi> field, near the Town of <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> gave a great defeat and ſlaughter unto the Army of that State, by reaſon of ambuſhes laid in places that were there fit for them, killing above 5000 men; moſt of the Towns ſuddenly yielding unto him, and many perſons, ſhewing their concealed good wills, now joyning with him; for which calamity of that Nation, the Engliſh ſympathizing, kept a publique Faſt. The Engliſh chief Army-Officers ſhewing alſo a freeneſs to adventure their lives for them, if domeſtique affairs would ſuffer.

But that he might have no cauſe to dote upon that imaginary protection; they repayed him again the ſame with uſury, the next year 1645. Who (beſides taking the Town of <hi>Roſate,</hi> which it ſeems was ſo battered, that there were ſcarce ten whole houſes remaining in it at the yielding; as alſo a ſtrong hold called Trinity-Fort) beat the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>Balaquere,</hi> chaſing them unto a place, called <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telme.</hi> And by intercepting the proviſion that was for its relief, forces the Town to yield to him.

And themſelves, who the year before attempted (as was ſaid) <hi>Hulſt</hi> in vain, do now make it yield by breaking thorow the ſame, vanquiſhing alſo two other fortreſſes.

                     <p>Memorable accidents in four years ſpace, are theſe; A miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance happened at <hi>Veſalia,</hi> where hundreds of pounds of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, being in the open Market-place laid into a Wagon by reaſon of the gaping chaps of the barrells, through the ſtriking of a horſes foot with his iron ſhooe againſt a flint ſtone, took fire; whereby, the adjoyning houſes were caſt down, and 30 people kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

At the City of <hi>Buda</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> it rained lead and Tin. And at <hi>Strigone</hi> a Town ſciruate on <hi>Danubius,</hi> the fiſhes flocking together, covered the River, ſhewing their heads above water, which thing the aged inhabitants, (it ſeems) from former obſervation, foretold to be a token of the change of their Lord and Maſter: theſe in 1642. But in the year 1644, in the
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:33388:245"/>Moneth of May, a great Wood (belonging to the Dukedome of <hi>Norimberg</hi>) of 8000 Acres of Land, burned in a flame, which is extraordinarily notable, if not ominous. The ſame year alſo <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningſmark</hi> the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Commander, had a ſtrange and ſad acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent befell his children and houſhold-ſervants by lightning, at the ſolemnities of the Funeral of a Major, at <hi>Minda;</hi> flaſhing upon his ſons: It defaced the firſt born's face, it ſmote the right ſide and arm of the ſecond, and the right arm of his third born; yet the eldeſt and youngeſt of his daughters had no hurt, but the ſervants, one and th' other were deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>Chances by fire in 1645, amongſt which theſe two were the ſaddeſt.

                     <p>The Queen of Poland the following year, 1644, when ſhe had brought forth a daughter named <hi>Claudia,</hi> breathed out her life in child-bed. Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the 8th, being above ſeventy years of age, and having been chief Biſhop 21 years, now alſo deceaſed.

And then being increaſed in ſtrength of Forces by the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> goeth down thorow <hi>Francony</hi> into <hi>Wette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rave</hi> and <hi>Haſsia,</hi> where he labours (though all in vain) to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or foreſtall both the Swediſh Camps and proviſion of victual. For, he triumphing in his Camps for the joy of his ſon <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the 4th, ſo called, who was choſen King of Bohemia, (whom to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of this year he ſo crowned) and alſo for the late return of <hi>Cornuburg</hi> into his hands. <hi>Wrangle</hi> ſlipping away, environeth the Emperour's Souldiers, and paſſing over the River <hi>Moenus,</hi> he bends his march unto <hi>Danubius.</hi> But <hi>Koningſmark</hi> the Swediſh Commander after one or two ſervices, and eſtſoon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing the Town of <hi>Breververd</hi> this year, doth joyn himſelf with <hi>Wrangle,</hi> when he had deſcended from <hi>Ilmene</hi> thorow <hi>Erford</hi> and <hi>Eichfield</hi> unto <hi>Viſurg.</hi> For he paſſed over the <hi>Mindean</hi> Foords, and had taken eight Towns, of which <hi>Paderborn</hi> was one. He forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his Camps at <hi>Amoenoburg,</hi> withſtood the <hi>Bavarians</hi> coming on with great force, and being by <hi>French</hi> Ayds made ſtronger, he preffeth upon, and encompaffeth them, that ſo they being kept apart from the River <hi>Moenus,</hi> he making haſte, might come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them unto <hi>Danubius</hi> to hinder their paſſage over that River, and leaving <hi>Schorndorf</hi> to win <hi>Turain</hi> by aſſault, he himſelf takes <hi>Nordling</hi> and two other conſiderable holds: which being done, he calls him unto him again, and fights againſt the City <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta</hi> of the <hi>Vindelicians,</hi> but overcame it not. He alſo had almoſt made Lyce or Lycum his own, notwithſtanding he intercepted warlique furniture, and large ſtore of victuall of the enemies more than once. But more than this, returning unto Memminge, he with the greateſt boldneſſe violently takes both the narrow paſſages that were between the Hills, and the Town of <hi>Brigant</hi> it ſelf, which is, as it were, the Key, opening unto, or ſhutting out of many Countreys, wherein was great ſpoyl and prey: as alſo <hi>Langenarch</hi> at the end of this year 1646, by ſurrender. In the mean time, the Caſtle of <hi>Marpurg</hi> being beſieged, is yielded to the beſiegers. But it coſt one <hi>Willick</hi> the Defender thereof, his head, at <hi>Gieſse.</hi> Two places ſoon after following that Caſtle's
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:33388:246"/>example. <hi>Butsback</hi> (notwithſtanding) being taken by <hi>Eberſtein</hi> the Emperian. In the upper parts of the Country this year are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued <hi>Smalcald,</hi> with ſour other places by the Emperour's Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, of which two, <hi>Kirichain,</hi> and <hi>Rauſchenburg,</hi> are loſt, with no proſperous conflict. <hi>Geiſe</hi> recovering <hi>Kirichain,</hi> demoliſheth the ſame, and vanquiſheth <hi>Alsfeld;</hi> getting alſo a victory over <hi>Eberſtein,</hi> who was increaſed in number by <hi>Melander,</hi> carrying back eight Waggons, with 500 priſoners of War, and 700 hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but this was after that <hi>Rabenhaupt</hi> had returned from the ſiege of <hi>Zonſe,</hi> and <hi>Melander</hi> had taken <hi>Euskirk</hi> and <hi>Flemburg;</hi> the waich example <hi>paderborn</hi> followed at the end of the year, taken before by <hi>Koningſmark.</hi> But the Duke of Wittemburg, bringing a ſupply unto the Swediſh forces in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> much troubleth or ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>Montecucule</hi> the Emperian, who at the firſt of the year had the upper-hand, and followes him, going back into Bohemia; he takes alſo <hi>Haſelcher,</hi> and two Towns more from the Emperians in the ſaid Sileſia; but beſieging <hi>Troppave</hi> a ſtrong Garriſon in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia,</hi> he loſt his labour.</p>
                     <p>The year following 1647, when as <hi>Wrangle</hi> had fortified the Iſland of <hi>Menave,</hi> together with the Caſtle of <hi>Lagenarch,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Meſſengers from Helvetia, had diſmiſſed them with a friendly anſwer, he departs there-hence for lack of graſſe or fod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; confirming alſo a ceſſation of arms at Monaſtere, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at Ulme, between the Swediſh, French, the Haſſians, and the Bavarian and Colonian. Then after ſome other paſſages of War, <hi>Koningſmark</hi> having beſieged Warendorf, there was a ſtout fight at Sea, when their Ships were brought unto the Podanian Lake, at four places. The <hi>Noveſians</hi> taking Nidek in the Julia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can field, and <hi>Wrangle,</hi> receiving ſupply, by his Captain <hi>Lowenhaupt, Nordling,</hi> and <hi>Sweinfurt.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> alſo returnes ſtoutly into <hi>Sileſia,</hi> and <hi>Dewage</hi> being caſt out of two places betook himſelf to Breſlave. Whoſe forces alſo taking the Town of Trau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenave, take alſo the Glogavians therein, with 146 Horſemen, 40 Footmen, 270 Horſes with bag and baggage. <hi>Bucheim</hi> and <hi>Spork</hi> Emperians make haſt, who beſieging Olave loſe their labour. But <hi>Mortane</hi> is ſent away unto Heſſe of Caſſella, who ſubdued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his power 9 Garriſons, whereof Fridberg, and a place called <hi>the Palatinate Fort,</hi> were two; but then beſieging <hi>Rheinfelſe,</hi> he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a mortall wound; whereupon there was a Truce made between the Haſſians and Emperians. But the Emperour not only diſliking, but diſdaining the conditions of the former Ceſſation of Arms, moſt violently aſſaults the Town and Garriſon of Weiſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, and wins it from his enemies the defenders. Appointing alſo the Earl of <hi>Holtſapfell,</hi> (who was of late known throughout Haſſia, where he warred, by the name of <hi>Melander,</hi> General, in the room of <hi>Gallaſse,</hi> who was by little &amp; little in a decaying ſtate of body, and thereupon repairing his Army, he fortifieth alſo three very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable places, to wit, <hi>Prague</hi> in Bohemia, <hi>Pilſene,</hi> &amp; <hi>Vienna,</hi> the City of his Palace in Germany on <hi>Danubius;</hi> and having done this, (as
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:33388:247"/>thinking he had done ſome great matter toward his protection and ſucceſſe) he bequeaths a Feaſt-day or holiday to be kept in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> Conception, and ſo commits himſelf, his affairs, and Souldiers unto her Guardianſhip. Being impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of a ceſſation, he withdrawes <hi>Werth</hi> and <hi>Spork,</hi> two chief Commanders of the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Army, from the ſaid Duke of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> (although they were condemned by him of treachery) and joyns them unto his new General <hi>Holtſapfel;</hi> but he excuſed that deed unto the Swedes and French, it having been perfidiouſneſſe in him, to have voluntarily ſent any of his, unto his aſſiſtance, againſt thoſe with whom he had a ceſſation from arms, within the limited time: He ſubdueth <hi>Falkenave,</hi> but going to hinder <hi>Egere</hi> from beſieging, he ſlackened his pace, being often ſtopped by over or fool-hardy <hi>Wrangle,</hi> (for that was his Epethite) in his very Camps, while he would break violently thorow unto a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bridge belonging unto a houſe of the Emperour's, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of friends. He fights at <hi>Plane,</hi> and two other places, with a diverſe iſſue, untill the <hi>Bavarian,</hi> the ceſſation of arms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, joyned himſelf unto him again; as alſo untill that <hi>Wrangle</hi> (calling <hi>Koningſmark</hi> unto him) ſhould ſnatch away, as it were, his Army thorow Bohemia toward <hi>Anneberg,</hi> and ſhould paſſe over unto Miſnia, Erford, and Viſurge of Hoxtere, that he might refreſh Souldiers at divers places, and then ſhew himſelf in Haſſia: whither the Emperour's and Bavarian forces follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; (for a cauſe moving them thereunto) they were pleaſed to beſiege the City Marpurg, where <hi>Holtſapfel,</hi> formerly <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> the Emperour's General, through a Splinter of a beam (which was occaſioned by the Caſtle's or Tower's Guns thundring into the place of his abode) breaking a vein of his neck, had almoſt breathed out his life, together with his bloud, by that open paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. But (after one or two places vanquiſhed by the Emperour, one whereof, to wit, Iglave, very hardly; and Nordling (that was taken this year, before, by <hi>Lawenhaupt</hi> the Swediſh Captain; as ſaith <hi>Mercurius Gallobelgicus</hi>) wickedly or unhappily retaken by the <hi>Bavarian</hi>) the Swediſh Noveſians perform'd notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, killing <hi>Goſse</hi> or <hi>Goce</hi> with 100 common Souldiers, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſaid Earl of <hi>Holtſapfell,</hi> ſome Majors, with 200 common Souldiers priſoners. Nevertheleſſe <hi>Lamboy</hi> (on the other ſide) watching his opportunity, vanquiſheth <hi>Windeke</hi> with three other ſtrong holds in Colonia, and from thence goes into Weſtphalia, although he was commanded by the Emperour to come with his Brigade unto the chief of his warlique affairs.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the ſame year, being 1647, the Souldiers of Turain are overcharged by Neighbouring garriſons of the Emperours, at <hi>Zwingenberg:</hi> and do aſſure the City <hi>Mentz,</hi> and <hi>Worms,</hi> againſt the ſubtile devices of both <hi>Garner</hi> and <hi>Boninghauſe.</hi> But there was like to be a falling out with their own fellow-Souldiers, about <hi>Roſe</hi> the Tribune, whom ſome Regiments required from the Army, to be reſtored their Captain; neither could they be
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:33388:247"/>brought to return to their duty by any means; but yet on ſome certain conditions they do joyn to <hi>Koningſmark. Roſe</hi> himſelf being brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> to declare the cauſe hereof. And when as the Colonian, now renounceth his ceſſation of arms made a while before, with the Swede, French, and Haſſians, by reaſon of a Town that was taken of theirs, in the mean time, and ſome other unworthineſſes received from the enemy; then <hi>Koningſmark,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing his number with <hi>Rabenhaupt</hi>'s Souldiers, (that proſpered in ſome atchievements the year before) begirts <hi>Paderborn</hi> that had been taken and retaken in 1646, and ſtoutly oppoſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt <hi>Lamboy</hi> at <hi>Steynford,</hi> as he pierced into <hi>Oſtro-Friſia,</hi> or Eaſt-Frieſland, and that, untill both Armies were ſummoned away unto the higheſt matters.</p>
                     <p>And truly, (as though things were now coming to the higheſt pitch) the Swediſh Commanders and Armies do hotly encounter the Imperial Forces (in the year 1648) to their diſadvantage. For <hi>Wrangle</hi> in the firſt place takes from the Duke of <hi>Luneburg</hi> 1400 horſes, and the cloathing for his Army; and calling a Council of War at <hi>Stade,</hi> he moveth toward <hi>Paderborn,</hi> where he drives away the Emperians and Bavarians out of Haſſia, where they wanted Victual, into Francony, having been ſufficiently worn out at the ſiege of Marpurg. Then increaſing his Army, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth over the River <hi>Moenus</hi> at Aſciburg, being 23000 ſtrong, 15000 footmen, 8000 horſemen, 160 great Guns, and 200 wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and by force wreſted 9 piece of Ordinance that were left by the Emperour's Army at <hi>Forcheym.</hi> And coming unto <hi>Eeuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wange,</hi> he ſets his Army in array; but the Emperour's forces do part aſunder, the Emperians departing unto Ratisbone, and the Bavarians unto Eichſtade; but <hi>Wrangle</hi> himſelf ſits down at Guntsburg; <hi>Koningſmark</hi> in the mean while wandring up and down, unto whom the aboveſaid diſcontented <hi>Turanian</hi> Souldier then came. Then after three places yielded, poſſeſſed, and laid waſte, and three others fortified: And the upper Palatinate put to extream villany by the rude and cruel Souldiers, at length there was a conflict about croſſing the River <hi>Lyce,</hi> (the French be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, coming to the Swedes, and covering <hi>Bavaria,</hi> upon which <hi>Bucheym</hi> and <hi>Spork</hi> are called out of Sileſia) toward the City <hi>Auguſta,</hi> and that, an unhappy one to the <hi>Emperians, Holt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſapſell</hi> their General being in the very reat ſlain, alſo <hi>Konigſmark</hi> brings away their Secretary, with 200 and 70 Common men, and ſo opened their paſſage in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> whither it appeares they were rending. (Two reaſons were given of this misfortune; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe <hi>Gronsfeld,</hi> Leader of the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Souldiery, had been Commanded (in imitation of the <hi>Haſſians</hi>) to decline the Front of the Battle, and bring his Souldiers to defend rather the more ſound or ſtrong parts thereof: or becauſe he envyed <hi>Holt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſapſell,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Holtſapſell</hi> having his Chief Officers the leſſe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto him, both in regard of the Rigour of his Army diſcipline,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:33388:248"/>and likewiſe, for that his Religious Rites were very much eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from theirs. But <hi>Koningſmark</hi> breaking into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and on July 16, making a free Egreſſe and Regreſſe unto the Town and Gariſon of <hi>Eger,</hi> that was ſhut up by the Enemy; on the 26 of the ſame moneth, he encompaſſing and taking 300 Scouts, or a party ſent forth, by a cunning Stratagem, brought a greater mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap unto the Emperour, than the other: who ſending forth by night as many of his own Souldiers unto <hi>Colored</hi> the Vice-King of Bohemia, under a colour of being his party that was ſent out, now returning, their Watch-word being firſt ſtollen; took by this diſguiſe before day, that which is called <hi>Little Prague,</hi> with the Caſtle of <hi>Rets</hi> or <hi>Retiſe</hi> thereto belonging, with more than 200 men of a great fame, whom he made them to ranſom. A prey alſo of above ſeven millions value, fell hereby into his hands, the richer part of which he ſends away in 60 Waggons unto Lipſia, <hi>Colored</hi> alſo the Vice-roy, hardly eſcaping from being ſeized on in his bed. <hi>Wrangle</hi> alſo croſſing Lyce, confirmeth one garriſon, and takes two into his poſſeſſion; the Emperour's ſliding away unto <hi>Viltshove,</hi> the <hi>Bavarians</hi> ſpreading themſelves into Garriſons to defend thoſe more ſtrong places, who, upon the loſing of Lyce, quitted or departed from <hi>Iſare,</hi> the which <hi>Wrangle</hi> poſſeſſeth wholly: who beſieging Waſſerburg, was fruſtrated of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and ſeeking a paſſage over the River <hi>Oene,</hi> could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, the Bavarian ſtoutly defending the right bank againſt him. Then he hath a conflict with the Emperians and Bavarians who revived again, at <hi>Dinckelſinge,</hi> and ſits down at <hi>Landſhute,</hi> being repulſed by <hi>Werth,</hi> who with great violence aſſailed them; the ſaid <hi>Werth,</hi> having been newly received into favour by the Duke of Bavaria, who before had a prejudice againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Leſt I ſhould be too tedious, let me briefly run over ſome acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of two or three more chief Swediſh Warriours this year. The Duke of Wittenberg (who was of that party, and was Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Ordnance,) that he might make amends for ſome loſſe that <hi>Dewage</hi> had ſuffered through a miſtake, which was 136 horſemen, and 336 horſes, runs to him; demoliſhing <hi>Oelſa,</hi> and preying upon Sileſia, and being increaſed with a ſupply of 6000 men from Pomerania and Moravia, breaks thorow into Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia, where, at Brandiſe, (the place where the image of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> trimly ſtood) he takes 600 of the enemies, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put into the room of <hi>Koningſmark,</hi> who was abſent, he ſhews himſelf before old <hi>Prague:</hi> and then poſſeſſeth a Town, and a Caſtle in that Kingdom; after that, paſſing thorow to <hi>Moldavia,</hi> about to come ſuddenly upon <hi>Miſling</hi> of <hi>Crumavia,</hi> he, at <hi>Budovice,</hi> lights upon <hi>Bucheym,</hi> with three other of eminency, that were bring 120 Waggons unto places of more ſafety; he takes them with their wagons, onely one <hi>Garner</hi> eſcaping, and ſo goes to meet their new General; who came out of Swethland amongſt theſe claſhings this year, with 8000 moſt choyſe Souldiers: (This
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:33388:248"/>was <hi>Charls Guſtave,</hi> who being begotten of his father <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> who was of the family of the Palatinates of <hi>Bipont,</hi> and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being the ſiſter of <hi>Guſtave Adolphus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi>) was Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen-german unto the Queen thereof; and unto whom ſhe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reſigned that Kingdom;) leading them from ſeveral places, untill he brought them into Bohemia, where he is received by <hi>Koningſmark,</hi> and the Duke of Wittenberg aforeſaid. His deſign was for the ſiege of Prague, unto which he breaks thorow: But of this by and by, when I have ſpoken a few things concerning ſome others.</p>
                     <p>Therefore <hi>Rabenhaupt</hi> the Haſſian, together with <hi>Duglas</hi> the Swede, (while that thoſe chiefeſt matters by the main Armies were tumbled out of <hi>Haſsia</hi> thorow <hi>Francony,</hi> unto <hi>Lyce,</hi> and into Bohemia) recovereth ſome places that the enemy had poſſeſſed, taking <hi>Homburg</hi> by force, where were 20 Ordnance very well fitted, another place by a ſlight, but raced or ſpoyled <hi>Gleichenſtein,</hi> and at length <hi>Geiſe</hi> is put in his place, with whom this year 1648, <hi>Lamboy</hi> contended: who cloſely beſieging <hi>Geiſe</hi> at Giſeck; through the valour of <hi>Erneſt</hi> the Lantgrave, who with 300 common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers brake in upon the beſiegers, ſets the beſieged at liberty, <hi>Lamboy</hi> loſing ſome hundreds of his men, (yet <hi>Erneſt</hi> himſelf was taken in the enterprize) who returning unto <hi>Bonne,</hi> and demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another place, he preſents himſelf at <hi>Grevenbruge</hi> before the Camps of <hi>Geiſe,</hi> and joyning battle, he routs the left wing of <hi>Geiſe</hi> his Army, taking priſoners the Earl of <hi>Weide,</hi> with 200 common men, and ſeven waggons. But while (as oft-times comes to paſſe) he the more ſharply purſues the diſperſed left wing, all his great guns were taken from his own right wing, and turned againſt him, ſo that he loſt what he had gotten, <hi>Geiſe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the Captives of the left wing, and beſides ſlew above a thouſand of <hi>Lamboy</hi>'s Army, took 500, above 13 Wagons, and 15 Enſignes, with the loſſe of but 160 men. <hi>Lamboy</hi> being thus worſted, (whom the Emperour indeed had commanded (as in the year before, 1647,) to come to his main Army; but the <hi>Colonian</hi> prevented it by ſhewing him, how much it concerned, not to leave Weſtphalia deſtitute of ſtrength) the Arch-Duke of Auſtria af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords him money, and the garriſons of Weſtphalia ſupply of men, making prayers to make God their friend. The firſt atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after this recruit and ſupplication was the ſurrender of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorium</hi> unto him: after which, he oppoſeth his Camps to the Haſſian Army almoſt within ſight of Agrippine a City of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia. <hi>Geiſe</hi> notwithſtanding (eſpecially when <hi>Frederick</hi> the Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave had brought him 1500 horſe) valiantly conquered the Town of Marcodure, <hi>Lamboy</hi> imploying his Auxiliaries in vain to hinder it: notwithſtanding he ſtoutly looſeth <hi>Paderborn</hi> from beſieging: and then both parties ſitting down over-againſt each other at <hi>Brakell</hi> in the ſaid Colonia; news is brought them of a concluded peace between them.</p>
                     <pb n="484" facs="tcp:33388:249"/>
                     <p>Which peace (without doubt) between ſuch accuſtomed and ſtomachful enemies, the prevalency of the Swediſh Forces this year, together with this new General's coming into Germany with ſuch freſh ſupplyes, cauſed; who ſets upon the City of Great <hi>Prague</hi> in good earneſt, making Mines under the ground, whither <hi>Bucheym,</hi> leſt it ſhould be ſubdued, ſwiftly came, that he might manfully withſtand the Forces of <hi>Charls,</hi> the ſaid new Swediſh Commander. Yet ſurely it was ſorely endangered; for into both <hi>Pragues,</hi> are carried no leſſe than 3286 ſtroaks of diſcharged Ordnance; the beſieger likewiſe poſſeſſing two places of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence within the Territories of new Prague, whither alſo the concluded peace is (not ſorrowfully) brought tydings of. It was firſt concluded of by moſt noble Embaſſadours on all ſides, in Weſtphalia, on the 14th and 24th day of October, 1648, whoſe Maſters eſtabliſhed it by their aſſent the two next moneths; the Emperour on the 13, and 23 of November, the French King on the 14, and 24 of the ſame; by the Swedes on the 12 and 24 of December; in which peace, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> (whether through prejudice conceived againſt him for the notoriouſneſſe of his Armies villany in Germany and Flanders, beſides ſpoyls done to the French) could not be included therein: and the King of Spain would not, whether out of enmity to the French, or hatred to the Proteſtants with whom it was concluded; for the Biſhop of Rome his moſt Great father, purſued with a Proteſtation againſt it, becauſe hereby his Church ſhould loſe both rich Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories and dignities.

Which was a great harbourer of Men of War for the King by Sea, that took great ſpoil of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ships, and from whence Prince <hi>Charls</hi> had not long before fled into <hi>Jerſey</hi>) and Colonel <hi>Maſseys</hi> brigade being by <hi>Fairfax</hi> qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly disbanded in the Weſt, among whom (about the difference of Presbytery and Independency in Church-Government, of which there were great factions then in <hi>England</hi>) a mutiny was feared, the war was even finiſhed, and Generall <hi>Fairfax</hi> came Novemb. the 12th with triumph into <hi>London,</hi> where by both houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, he was (in order) moſt amply and heartily congratulated, unto which he replyed with a ſhort modeſt anſwer. The Earl of <hi>Eſsex</hi> their firſt Generall, that brake the Ice, dying (as is ſaid) of an Apoplexy, the 13th of Sept. aforegoing, who on the 22th of Octob. following, was moſt pompouſly (by the Parliament) inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>But the next year 1647, was partly ſpent in the diviſions of fellow Conquerours, and many others, divided under the name of Presbyterians and Independants; the former complaining that the ſolemn Covenant was not kept, the latter, that it was miſinterpreted: the Royaliſts in the mean time ready to joyn with either for their own advantage, very many having out of taken-Garriſons reſorted to <hi>London.</hi> Theſe diſſentions increaſing, Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were both preſented to the Parliament againſt the Army as Independants, and the Parliament themſelves debated of disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, againſt which (as wronged) they Petitioned the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, becauſe they neither had their Arrears, nor the Laws and Liberties they had fought for, were obtained. And although the other party much ſtomached and complained of the ſaid Petition. yet on June the fourth, 1647, the King was by a party (under the command of one Cornet <hi>Joyce</hi>) taken from <hi>Holmby,</hi> and carried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeverall places, according to the removing of the Armies quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Whereupon, the Parliament ordered where he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, which was at <hi>Richmond,</hi> but eight miles from <hi>London,</hi> and alſo who ſhould attend and Guard him. But in ſtead of fullfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſame order, there was ſent from the Army an impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt eleven members of the Commons, as hinderers of right, doing ſomething againſt the Army it ſelf, and hindering <hi>Irelands</hi> relief, the which, had been, as was thought, too long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed already by reaſon of the Kings going to the Scots.

And on <hi>Aug.</hi> the ſixth, the departed Members, were (by the Army) reſtored to their ſitting. Who with a full body, the next day, Aug. 7. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thorow the City, ſlighting its Works and Forts, taking poſſeſſion of the Tower, and confining its Militia to its own onely bounds, receiving alſo a Moneths pay from the Parliament in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification; all this being to the gladding of ſome, and the grief and vexation of others.</p>
                     <p>This being done, the Army Aug. the 18th, 1647. remonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their deſires for the Parliaments cloſing with the King, and that he might come to <hi>London</hi> upon that cloſure; Yet the Scotch Commiſſioners (who, before ſatisfaction given unto his people, had denied the juſtneſſe of his acceſſion thither) would have had him now out of the Armies hands, perſonally to treat at <hi>London;</hi> however to ſtay at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, whither he came, Aug. 24. Propoſitions were ſent him thither, unto which to conſent he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; More were again framed, and in the mean time, Nov. 11. he privily fled into the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> leaving a Letter behind him, ſhewing, the end of it was, to preſerve his own ſafety, againſt whoſe life ſome laid wait. About ſeven dayes after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither from <hi>Carisbrook</hi> Caſtle, he ſent to the Parliament a Letter, in which he was earneſt for a perſonall treaty at <hi>London,</hi> that might be accompanied with three appendices, honour, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſafety; they voted, Novemb. 26. that upon ſigning four propoſitions, in order to ſecurity, which ſeemed not unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that ſhould be admitted: who nevertheleſſe, the Scots be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing averſe unto the ſaid bills preſenting, and people divided into parties in <hi>London,</hi> flatly refuſed to confirm the ſame, for which cauſe, they voted Jan. the third, that no further addreſſes ſhould be made unto him, or meſſuage received from him by themſelves, or any other without their leave. Which Votes, the Generall, and Army-Councell on the eleventh day ſeconded with a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:33388:251"/>reſolving to cleave to the Parliament in ſetling the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes affairs, both without, and againſt the King, or any of his partakers.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Votes, and Army-Declaration, inflamed rather than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed the anger and fury of many people, who not onely longed for, but expected the King to be reſtored unto his former dignity, although the Parliament ſought by another Declaration, (ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how often they had applyed themſelves unto the King, yet all in vain) to aſſwage their diſturbed minds: ſo that tumnlts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections (the beginnings of a ſecond war) were not onely fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but raiſed; the firſt of which was that in the Iſle of Wight it ſelf, near the very Caſtle in which the King was; for which, the principal Leader, Captain <hi>Burleigh,</hi> was at an Aſſizes, called at <hi>Wincheſter</hi> on purpoſe, condemned for Treaſon, and executed Febr. 10. 1647. Notwithſtanding in the moneth of April 1648, <hi>London</hi>'s Apprentices, and other young people, gave a notable example of war and ſedition unto adjacent places, who ſaying they were for <hi>Charls</hi> their King, put the whole City in great fear, the Lord Maior being conſtrained to betake himſelf unto the Tower, who the next day by a party ſent by General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> were vanquiſhed and quieted, and a thouſand pound given to the Souldiers for the ſervice. The Duke of <hi>York</hi> eſcaping (in the ſame April) from <hi>James</hi> his houſe near <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> out of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments hands. And the Prince being as a baniſhed man in the peoples eye, by private Commiſſions from his Father the King, raiſed war; which war ſeemed more formidable and dangerous unto the Parliament and Army than the former, both in regard of the Scots, who from aſſiſting friends, were turned threatening enemies, and chiefly thoſe that were called <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> ſiding both in <hi>London</hi> and the Countrey with the Royaliſts upon the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>-account.</p>
                     <p>Now divers ſtrong holds were ſeized on for the King, as <hi>Barwick,</hi> April the 30th, by Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale;</hi> and <hi>Carlile</hi> about the beginning of May following; <hi>Pontfract</hi> Caſtle, (where alſo Colonel <hi>Rainsborough</hi> was treacherouſly by the enemy after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, Octob. 29, taken in his bed and ſlain, as he lay at the ſiege thereof,) was June the third ſurprized by a Major and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the King's, having firſt killed the Governour. Before which, on May the 12th, there was an Inſurrection at <hi>St. Edmonds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> not far from <hi>London,</hi> and a ſeditious Petition by the <hi>Surrey</hi>-men on the 16th day, the Petitioners beſides hurting, killing one of the Parliament's guard; for which, themſelves were by ſome horſe ſcattered, and ſome killed. A far greater on the 24th day was by the Men of <hi>Kent,</hi> with whom divers great ones of that Country joyned; Great toyl it coſt <hi>Fairfax</hi> (who was with ſeven Regiments engaged againſt theſe riſers) to ſubdue them: the greateſt conflict was at the Town of <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> where with very much difficulty, and no ſmall danger with the loſſe of 40 men, the place was obtained, againſt about 2000 defendants, 200 being

Thouſands of their Countrey-men of the ſame party, looking on, in the mean time, and not daring to oppoſe the General. A rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of this <hi>Kentiſh</hi>-Army under the Lord <hi>Goring</hi>'s conduct, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached high <hi>London,</hi> to ſee the affections of the Citizens, who being purſued by ſome Horſemen of the Army, <hi>Goring</hi> with four or five hundred of them croſſed the River into Eſſex, where the Lord <hi>Capell,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charls Lucas</hi> with forces joyned with them, who notwithſtanding were ſoon afterwards driven into the City of <hi>Colcheſter</hi> (unto whom many from <hi>London</hi> reſorted) by <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and after a pretty long ſiege, the beſieged having no hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and being brought to great ſtraights, horſe-fleſh being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted good meat, Aug. 28. yielded themſelves into the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's hands, two of whom were ſhot to death, to wit, Sir <hi>Charls Lucas,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Liſle.</hi>

                     <p>But (to leave other riſings in the Weſt and other places, becauſe they were ſoon quelled) much danger threatened the Parliaments Cauſe in <hi>Wales,</hi> by <hi>Laughorn, Poyer,</hi> and <hi>Powell</hi>'s conjoyning, who before had done the Parliament (eſpecially <hi>Laughorn</hi>) good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The ſaid <hi>Laughorn</hi> with <hi>Powell</hi> having an Army of 8000 men in the field; unto the which one Colonel <hi>Horton</hi> with but 3000 gave a compleat overthrow, killing many, and taking about 3000 priſoners; this was in <hi>May.</hi> Thoſe two flying unto <hi>Poyer</hi> in <hi>Pembrook</hi>-Caſtle, a moſt ſtrong place, (after that <hi>Chepſtow</hi>-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was ſurrendred unto another Parliament Commander, whoſe chief Defendant Sir <hi>Nicholas Kemiſh,</hi> was after the yielding, <hi>May</hi> 25, ſlain,) <hi>Cromwell</hi> after a while about July had it yielded unto him, with the oppoſers all priſoners; extremities within conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them thereunto.</p>
                     <p>The Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> alſo (who before had played faſt and looſe) now taking his opportunity, with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> was in arms at <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Thames</hi> with 500 horſemen, who was put to flight by Sir <hi>Michael Leveſey,</hi> and afterwards taken and ſent to <hi>Warwick</hi> Caſtle; the Lord <hi>Francis,</hi> the Duke's brother, being in the Combate ſlain.</p>
                     <p>The plundring forces alſo belonging unto <hi>Pomfret</hi> Caſtle were quite vanquiſhed by Colonel <hi>Roſsiter,</hi> who, in that action, was ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though not mortally wounded.</p>
                     <p>But the greateſt block to leap over, was a Scottiſh Army under Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Command, who (though they were judged to be both that Kirks and Kingdoms enemies, and ſo had not their good wiſhes for their ſucceſſe) invaded <hi>England</hi> about or in the moneth of June, and a little after being added unto by <hi>Langdale</hi>'s forces, were ſtrong in number, having no leſſe than 25000, and cruel and terrible unto the Inhabitants where they came. This Army Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> kept in play, untill Lievtenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Cromwell</hi> (<hi>Pembroke</hi>-Caſtle being ſeaſonably delivered unto him) could come to joyn with him, who being in all not full ten thouſand ſtrong, Aug. 17. 1648, wholly vanquiſhed and defeated
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:33388:252"/>that Army, took the Lievtenant General, and ſoon after the Duke himſelf in flight with 3000 horſe, 3000 having been before ſlain, and 9000 taken priſoners. The Conquerour, <hi>Cromwell,</hi> after this, entring <hi>Scotland</hi> with a happy ſucceſſe, ayded that Nation againſt ſome enemies, that there ſtood up, (reducing alſo <hi>Baruick</hi> and <hi>Carlile</hi>) and was by them both magnificently entertained, and ingenuouſly acknowledged (under God) <hi>Scotland</hi>'s <hi>Preſerver,</hi> whoſe Army was before called by many of them, A company of Sectaries.</p>
                     <p>Divers ſhips likewiſe revolted from the Parliament unto the Prince by Sea, at the beginning of June, not ſuffering <hi>Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> the Vice-Admiral to come aboard: ſo that the Prince within two moneths after, was with near 20 ſayl upon Thames, out-daring the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who was too weak for him: But through the prudence of Sir <hi>George Ayſcough,</hi> the Portſmouth Fleet was brought by the Princes ſhips ſafe unto the Earl, and then they followed the Prince upon the coaſt of <hi>Holland,</hi> whither he was gone to victual.</p>
                     <p>In the midſt of theſe ſtirs, (whether in love or fear of the King and his Cauſe, the Parliament themſelves altered their former Votes, nulling on June 30, 1648, thoſe for no further Addreſſes to the King, Jan. 30. before, (having admitted the 11 impeached Members) And voted, (though not a Perſonal Treaty at <hi>London,</hi> yet an honourable one to be had with him, he firſt accepting thereof, upon Propoſitions, in the Iſle of Wight, which began Septemb. 18 this year, 5 Lords, and 10 Commons being choſen as Commiſſioners to treat, and 10000 l. to defray the charges of the ſame. It laſted about 9 weeks, untill Novemb. 27.</p>
                     <p>But in the mean time, this new war being now over, and the Army at ſome leiſure, its Councel of Officers altogether diſliking that Treaty, gave a prevalency (by a <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> of theirs unto the Parliament, Novemb. 20) unto divers County Petitions deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the moneths September and October, for the execution of impartial Juſtice upon ſome aforementioned, as <hi>Hamilton,</hi> &amp;c. authors of much bloud and calamity, and eſpecially on King <hi>Charls</hi> himſelf, as the raiſer of the whole War, and that God's wrath might be feared to attend them, if he were unpuniſhed. Whereupon, when as the King's Conceſſions in the Iſle of Wight, were Decemb. 5. following, voted ſatisfactory by the Parliament; the next day, divers Members that had ſo voted, were both ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from ſitting, and confined, by the Army; and a little after, the King was brought out of the Iſland unto <hi>Hurſt</hi> Caſtle, by a party of Horſe, and ſo to <hi>Windſor,</hi> Decemb. 23. And after the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream authority voted to be in the Houſe of Commons, Jan. 4. there was an Ordnance made for the King's Tryal on the 6th day; in order to which, an unuſual Court, called, an <hi>High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> was erected, on the 9th day, before whom the King appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jan. 20, and when as he would not plead to his Accuſation, as being unſatisfied in that Courts power to judge him, (but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Amongſt which actions, Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> who had likewiſe rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Forces for the King in this laſt War, Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> Lord <hi>Capell,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Owen,</hi> were all brought to a Tryall before a ſecond High Court of Juſtice, which began Febr. 10, and after ſentence of death paſſed on all five, March the 6th, two, to wit, Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Owen,</hi> were on March the 8th re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieved, and the next day the other three beheaded in the Palace-Yard of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> Lord <hi>Capell</hi> behaving himſelf the moſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and undauntedly at the time of execution. And to cloſe up this year in <hi>England,</hi> after the voting down of the Lords in Parliament, the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> a Peer, was removed from his Admiralſhip at Sea, Febr. 21; and the next day, a conſiderable ſhip called the <hi>Hart</hi>-Frigot revolted from this new State.

But it was otherwiſe in <hi>Flanders</hi> this year: for by his Captains, the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> and <hi>Enguienne,</hi> he firſt obtains the Town and garriſon of <hi>Cortrack</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> although they had a ſharp conflict with him at <hi>Cuerne</hi> about it; and then wins <hi>Vinociberg</hi> and <hi>Mardike</hi> by aſſault, and at length that notable place for Pyrates, <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> a very great help and ſafety to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, if he could have kept it.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who (as was ſaid) had conſulted with the <hi>French.</hi> of aſſailing the <hi>Spaniard</hi> on both ſides of <hi>Flanders,</hi> do intercept <hi>Tiene</hi> by the croſſing paſſage of the River <hi>Moſe,</hi> taking therewith many Captives of no ſmall name and fame; yet they vainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour this year, 1646, to take <hi>Venloe</hi> by ſiege. Neither indeed is any thing performed by them beſides, worth the price of their warfare, unleſſe it were, that by buſying the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> they helped the <hi>French</hi> Expedition. They agree alſo to reſtore places that were poſſeſſed by them in the <hi>Juliacan</hi> field, unto the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who married <hi>Ludovica,</hi> daughter to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame year the King of <hi>Poland</hi> having joyned himſelf in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to <hi>Nivernia</hi> at <hi>Warſove,</hi> he gives a hearing unto an Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the great Duke of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> concerning a League to be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually made againſt the <hi>Tartars.</hi> And fearing war from both Turks and Tartars, he ſtudies warfare; againſt which, the States (fearing an oppreſſion of their Country thereby) do ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour. Whoſe brother <hi>Caſimir</hi> is now counted or enrolled amongſt the number of Cardinals: but being diſappointed of the title of a Kingly brightneſſe conferred on him, (ſuch was his zeal) he quite left that pretended holy order.</p>
                     <p>Now alſo the Turk and Venetian do ſtruggle, <hi>John Capello</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing declared General for theſe, in the room of <hi>Francis Erizzo,</hi> who dyed this year 1646, and <hi>Francis Molino</hi> chief Captain of the Dukes Navy, both aged men, the firſt above ſeventy years of age, the ſecond one under. <hi>Degenfield</hi> commanding his forces through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> the which, Turkiſh weapons made to tremble, for <hi>Noviograde</hi> is yielded unto him, and <hi>Zare</hi> is overcome; yet the <hi>Venetian</hi> recovered them both again, freeing another place from ſiege, and ſlaying the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> of <hi>Boſnia,</hi> the Turk vanquiſheth <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanion</hi> Caſtle, but he is overcome at <hi>Dardanelly,</hi> and again by Sea,
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:33388:253"/>loſing three Oar-Galleys; yet had the upper hand at <hi>Canea</hi> through the errour or obſtinacy of the Commander <hi>Valettane. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pello</hi> alſo, craving excuſe for his age, had <hi>John Baptiſta</hi> of <hi>Grimane</hi> for ſucceſſour in his General-ſhip, after which, they joyning a doubtfull battel with the Turks at <hi>Retime,</hi> a Town that yielded it ſelf unto their violence, the <hi>Venetians</hi> (who think their contention againſt the Turk a kind of holy War) run to three remedies; Prayers, Alms-Deeds, and Embaſſages to other Princes to intreat their aid and aſſiſtance. The Jews alſo being taken in the very act in paſſing over or conveighing Weapons to the Turks.</p>
                     <p>Moreover the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> the ſame year, ſends an Embaſſadour into <hi>Swethland,</hi> being by all neighbourlineſſe ſtudious of peace. A Swediſh Embaſſadour <hi>de la Garde</hi> going likewiſe to <hi>Paris,</hi> and another from the <hi>Tranſilvanian,</hi> comming unto Lypſia, the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians</hi> at the ſame time, treating in their publique Aſſemblies about confirming peace with the ſaid <hi>Tranſilvanian</hi> Prince, and likewiſe with their Emperour (who before had Crowned his ſon their King) concerning rooting out the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> from amongſt them. This honour alſo (at <hi>Stockholm</hi>) the <hi>Swedes</hi> afford unto <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtave Guſtaviſon</hi> the illegitimate ſon of their late King, to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among their Earls, although not capable of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                     <p>But the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (who it ſeems is full of money) beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth 18000 Crowns on a Chain to ſhut up the Haven of <hi>Civita Vec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia</hi> in 1647. Yet (as not having enough) in 1649, he is at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> about the Dutchy of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the Fee-farm of the Church, They joyn battel about it, but the Duke hath the upper hand, and then the Biſhop layes the blame of moving that war, on <hi>Godfride</hi> a Marqueſſe; but comes to an agreement with the Duke for a round ſumme, paying him 300000 Crownes preſently down, and 600000 Crowns to be told out to him a while after. Notwithſtanding the <hi>Caſtro</hi> (which I underſtand to be the houſe or Pallace belonging to the land) is laid equall with the ground. And before the year was ended, a Jubilee or Feaſt of joy and rejoycing is in a ſolemn (though Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh) manner opened or prepared at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame year there is a new Governour for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the Netherlands, to wit, <hi>Leopold,</hi> Arch-Duke of Auſtria; he ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth three Towns, <hi>Armentere</hi> that was laden with all kind of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, alſo <hi>Comene</hi> and <hi>Lenſe;</hi> and afterwards <hi>Landreſe,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> (at the ſame time) quickly taking <hi>Baſsea</hi> and <hi>Dixmude,</hi> attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting alſo <hi>Newport,</hi> and at <hi>Wawer</hi> at <hi>Bruxells,</hi> carrying all the ſpoil out of the place, turned 80 houſes into aſhes. Yet now as a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of a league, there is a ceſſation of arms beween the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> but <hi>Chemleve</hi> returns with diſgrace unto <hi>Dixmude,</hi> while <hi>Ranzove</hi> another <hi>French</hi> man retakes (with great pains) <hi>Lenſe</hi> from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> loſing ſix eminent perſons in the atchievement. unto this Countrey alſo are brought out of the Indies ten Millions and a half of Gold.</p>
                     <pb n="494" facs="tcp:33388:254"/>
                     <p>Somewhat there was to do likewiſe between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> on the other ſide of <hi>France,</hi> this taking one place from the <hi>French,</hi> &amp;c. But this was remarkable, that <hi>Lerida</hi> was now ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended againſt the Prince of <hi>Condee,</hi> who was General there in the room of <hi>Harcourt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the next year, 1648, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> (ſetting forth his Souldiers, and laying out his money at <hi>Oſtend,</hi> brings an Army into the field of 27000, ſubduing <hi>Cortrack,</hi> and yielding <hi>Ypre</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> and afflicts <hi>Ranzove</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Commander, who was now gaping for <hi>Ostend</hi> it ſelf. Yet he ſuffers a notable ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and overthrow at <hi>Lenſe,</hi> for the <hi>French</hi> being increaſed by the Army of <hi>Erlack,</hi> beats the <hi>Spaniard</hi> grievouſly; <hi>Beck</hi> and his ſon being both ſlain, and taking the Prince of <hi>Ligne,</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Grana,</hi> with twenty Captains, 6000 &amp; 200 Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouldiers, fourty Great Gnns, 90 Enſignes. Through <hi>Italy</hi> the <hi>Spaniard</hi> takes <hi>Furn,</hi> but loſeth it again, and receiveth loſſe by the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> at <hi>Pade,</hi> who ſcattered 700 <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and again, kills 300 of them, taking 1000 and 300. The <hi>French</hi> King alſo ſending the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> privily amongſt the ſeditious <hi>Neopolitans,</hi> was diſappointed of betraying the Towre or Caſtle of <hi>Carmine;</hi> the Duke was taken, and was not let go but with a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Moreover homebred troubles ariſe now in <hi>France,</hi> (a chief cauſe being the oppreſſion of the people, which is not ſmall in that Kingdome) the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> together with the Senate ſtriking at the Court, yet there was a preſent quietneſſe, when as the King had changed the Judges of criminall cauſes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what eaſed the people by Parliament. But (as a ſore not healed to the bottome) the diſtemper grew freſh again, when as the Duke of <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> more freely pleading the peoples cauſe, was caſt into bonds, the King going aſide unto the Temple of Saint <hi>Germanes.</hi> But at length, before this year's expiration, which is 1648, when the Captive Duke was reſtored, there is a ſecond reſt, the King returning unto <hi>Paris,</hi> though with very much intreaty. A home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred conſpiracy (likewiſe) there was made at <hi>Madrid</hi> the chief City in <hi>Spain,</hi> for the which, two chief actours, <hi>Charls</hi> of <hi>Padigle,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Sylvapegme,</hi> Princes, loſt their lives.</p>
                     <p>While theſe things were in action, the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and <hi>Coſſacks</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>Poland:</hi> the one waſting the Countrey, being inſtant for their tribute: and the other, for the reſtraining their antient Religious rites, and the robberies of the Lievtenants of their Countries. They take two confiderable places of <hi>Poland</hi> this year 1648 into poſſeſſion. And <hi>Dominick</hi> the <hi>Polanders</hi> General, deſpiſing the counſell of <hi>Wieſnewick,</hi> a chief Officer of that Army, is by theſe <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks</hi> put to flight, loſing 72 piece of Ordnance, and 20000 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, requiring for the renſome of the Captive General, a great ſum: this great loſſe cauſed great ſtrife in their publick aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, ſo that they fought there about it. But <hi>Chmielinsky</hi> the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> will have it decreed amongſt them concerning the Religious matters of his Countrey, and Family, and the next
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:33388:254"/>year the new King of <hi>Poland, John Caſsimir</hi> who was choſen the year before 1648, and now in 1649 Crowned, (who alſo marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his brothers Widow bound in her bed) moving againſt both the <hi>Coſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> the <hi>Coſacks</hi> by force obtain both their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ceremonies of Religion, and an amendment of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Common-wealth. But the <hi>Coſacks</hi> ſlew in <hi>Poland</hi> in the year 1648 <hi>(So cruel were they)</hi> 8000 Jews, and above 200000 Natives.</p>
                     <p>Toward the latter end of this year, <hi>Frederick,</hi> who was of late Arch-biſhop of <hi>Bremes,</hi> is Crowned King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> this Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man could not ſay, <hi>My Kingdome is not of this World.</hi> And <hi>Mary Ellenor</hi> the Queen Widow of <hi>Guſtave Adolphus,</hi> is brought, (Peace being now concluded in <hi>Germany</hi>) from <hi>Wolgaſt</hi> with honour and ſolemnity unto <hi>Stockholm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Venetians</hi> afflict the Turks both by Sea and land, in 1647 and 1648. for the Chriſtian Navy under the Knights of <hi>Malta</hi> poſſeſſe ſome places in their enemies Land, taking many Oar-galleys, their land Army doing the like throughout <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> which loſſes made the Turkiſh Emperour gnaſh his teeth for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, at his Captains. Preys alſo being taken from him in <hi>Hungary,</hi> where he keeps a Baſhaw. And in 1648, <hi>Foſcol</hi> the Land-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſcourgeth them in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> vanquiſhing three Towns, and then diſperſing 4000 of theſe Infidels, two places more yielded themſelves unto <hi>Foſcol,</hi> yet he loſt <hi>Licca,</hi> and elſwhere the Turk had ſome Maſterdome. But the <hi>Venetians</hi> get <hi>Mirabell</hi> in <hi>Creet</hi> or <hi>Candy,</hi> with the Victualling ſhips: and his loſſe by ſhipwrack was great; <hi>Grimmane</hi> the High-Admirall with 1000 and 600 Souldiers, with the value of 14 Millions: the <hi>Venetian</hi> fights proſperouſly againſt him alſo at the Forts of <hi>Dardanell;</hi> for which buſineſſe, the Governour and three Baſhaws were flain at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> thirty Galleys come laden to <hi>Cannea</hi> with Souldiers and Victualls from the Turk this year, where two Forts are loſt and recovered by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and that with much bloud, the Earl of <hi>Solm</hi> falls in battel, with ſeventeen Captains of a hundred men. The <hi>Venetians</hi> maintaining alſo the Haven of the pleaſant Vale of <hi>Suda</hi> in that fruitfull Iſland, againſt the oppoſing Turks, whoſe Emperour or <hi>Sultan Ibraim,</hi> is reported about the ſame time, by reaſon of his Tyranny, to have given place unto his ſon, which if ſo, muſt be, by the <hi>Timariots,</hi> and however the <hi>Janizaries</hi> willing it ſo to be.</p>
                     <p>The year following, 1649, (which according to the <hi>Germane</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, takes its beginning at <hi>January,</hi> but according to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> not untill March 25.) the <hi>Swediſh</hi> and Emperian-weapons are changed into conſultations for eſtabliſhing and confirming that peace, which was the year before agreed on. For the which, three Dukes come together at <hi>Norimberg,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Amalſe</hi> from the Emperour, of <hi>Ersken</hi> for <hi>Sweden,</hi> and of <hi>Vandort</hi> in the name of <hi>France;</hi> where they treat of four things, reſtitution of what was poſſeſſed, ſatisfaction for injuries, emptying or quitting of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:33388:255"/>and paying of the Souldiers. Amongſt other things, this was done. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> Souldier was ſpread thorow ſeven Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles allotted them by the Emperour, untill the final confirmation of the peace. And five Millions are wrung out for diſcharging the ſaid <hi>Swediſh</hi> Souldiers. The emptying was begun at three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral diſtances of time, by equall eſtimations; ſo now, when at length he had the Articles of higheſt concernment confirmed, then <hi>Ludovick</hi> the <hi>Palatinate</hi> is ſuffered to return unto <hi>Heidleberg,</hi> the cauſe of whoſe Countries reſtoring we ſee, was not upon ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto the Emperour, ſo much as upon conditions of Peace. This being done, the Emperour was preſent this year at <hi>Poſone,</hi> among the publick Aſſemblies of the land, where he would not admit of the burdens of his Clergy, that had been toſſed to and agen in debate ſince the year 1603. againſt the Proteſtants, whatever oppoſition the Arch-biſhop made againſt the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
                     <p>Yet the Conditions of peace were not fully agreed on untill the next year, 1650; for they now alſo ſtoutly labour thereabout at <hi>Norimberg;</hi> but when as <hi>Hailbrunne,</hi> with 3000 Royals a month, out of the publique Treaſury, were allowed for three moneths time unto the Palatinate, untill the matter could be otherwiſe compoſed, and four times five unto the Garriſon of <hi>Francodale;</hi> there were three terms of time appointed, in which places that were kept of the Emperour's by others, (of whom, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> held three, <hi>Hammerſteyn, Landſtule,</hi> and <hi>Homburg</hi>) ſhould be voyded: The <hi>French</hi> King lets go all Towns in the Coaſt of <hi>Rhene,</hi> beſides the Cities of the Wood. The Emperour ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens Prague and Eger, with the ſame frontier that lay againſt the Turks; he receiveth Olmuce, and other places, as the Duke of <hi>Luneburg</hi> did Nieburg at Viſurge: and then the Souldier was payd off and diſcharged, who goes down by Companies unto the pay of the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> from whence ſome fearful minds in <hi>Germany</hi> (the <hi>Spaniard</hi> being hereby ſtrengthened, and the hired being Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of fortune) foretold ſome hurtfull and unhappy thing to enſue.</p>
                     <p>But to leave <hi>German</hi>-events, and return unto <hi>Brittains</hi> tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; after that <hi>Charls</hi> the late King was taken out of the way, and other Capital enemies, amongſt whom, Colonel <hi>Poyer</hi> was ſhot to death, April 25. 1649, this ſecond (though but ſhort) War being over in <hi>England,</hi> that Common-wealth ſpeedily ſet about the tranſporting a conſiderable part of their victorious Army into <hi>Ireland,</hi> that had been too long hindered of relief by domeſtique interruptions, whereby the united parties there (having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed young <hi>Charls</hi> their King) had very much prevailed, as by and by we ſhall ſpeak: But there was a preſent ſtop made hereto by parties in the Army it ſelf, ſirnamed, if not nick-named, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,</hi> as that they ſhould profeſſe to lay every man's eſtate equal by force: Yet this I onely find, that thoſe ſo called, refuſed to paſs over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> untill they ſhould ſee (the King being now gone,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:33388:255"/>who was by them and his Judges accounted a Tyrant) ſome foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of reformation in the Common-wealth touching the Law, Tythes, &amp;c. according to ſome former vows made both by Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Army; and chiefly according unto ſomething not long before drawn up, which was called, <hi>An Agreement of the People,</hi> preſented to the Parliament, Jan. 19. 1648. This refuſal, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſiſtance of theirs, was at this time eſteemed both unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and giving an ill example unto others; ſo that April 27, 1649, one <hi>Lockier</hi> was ſhot to death in <hi>London</hi> (after ſome reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance made againſt his apprehenders) as an arch-ſtickler in this deſign: whom that party openly carried to his grave, in a kind of ſtately affront (as was judged) with Sea-green colours, at that time, the badge of ſuch. Then they gathered themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in arms at <hi>Burford</hi> in Oxfordſhire, whither not a few of the Army were coming to joyn with them. But General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and the Lievtenant General <hi>Cromwell</hi> in heat and ſpeed marched <hi>May</hi> the 9th againſt them, and an Officer being the day before ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in way of treaty and affability; inſtead of what they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, they were ſurprized on the 15th day by the General's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, three of the chief actors being ſhot to death, and another (a preaching Cornet) upon recantation pardoned. But one <hi>Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> a ſtout-fellow, eſcaping, ſtood in his own defence, who being purſued, was at length ſlain in a place called <hi>Wellingborough</hi>-Wood; their former fellow-Souldiers, now being enemies, behaving themſelves fiercely and roughly towards the ſurprized. And at the ſame time that this was doing, (which was on the 16th of May) <hi>England</hi> was voted a free-State. (General <hi>Fairfax</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this reducement three dayes after, <hi>May</hi> 29, 1649) Whereupon an Act for aboliſhing Kingly Government was <hi>May</hi> the 30th, proclaimed in <hi>London</hi> by the Lord Mayor of that City.</p>
                     <p>The Impediments of <hi>Ireland</hi> being now removed, <hi>Cromwell,</hi> now made Lord Deputy of that Kingdom, thought upon his march thitherward, the which he began July the 30th following: But the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> being hardly beſieged by the Iriſh Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe, <hi>Ormond,</hi> with an Army of 22000 men, which began June the 21, (and <hi>London-Derry</hi> by ſome of the rebellious there, for theſe two ſtrong holds were onely left unto the Parliament) about 3000 horſe and foot were poſted away before-hand to <hi>Dublin,</hi> who joyning themſelves with 6000 more at the moſt, under the Command of Colonel <hi>Jones,</hi> ſallied out, and totally routed and defeated <hi>Ormona</hi>'s beſieging Army, killing nigh 2000, taking many, with all their great Guns, Ammunition, &amp;c. as alſo a wealthy ſpoyl; This was on Auguſt 2. 1649, about 14 dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore L. G. <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s arriving there with his conſiderable Army; who being come, loſt no time, but ſoon after beſieged <hi>Drogheda,</hi> a ſtubborn place, and, by ſtorming, made it yield indeed, in a ſhort time, but not without ſweat and bloud unto the Conquerour, who (for terrour's ſake to others) killed with the ſword nigh 3000
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:33388:256"/>armed men after entrance therein: and then the confederates mouldred down apace, garriſons being taken and yielded, and field-parties routed, in great number. Nevertheleſs, the Natives being expert in the Bogs and Woods of that Country, whither they retired and ſheltred themſelves, made a perfect reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, much longer than otherwiſe it would have been.</p>

                     <p>A little before this, news was brought to <hi>England</hi> of ſome of their Plantations that fell off from obedience to this State, and either thinking or ſaying to themſelves according to the Roman Proverb, <hi>[Antiquum volo,]</hi> I will have the old Law ſtill, I will have no Innovations; puniſhed divers with branding, fines, and baniſhment, for not conforming unto Monarchy, and the old Church-Liturgy: theſe were <hi>Virginia,</hi> and thoſe called <hi>Carybe-Iſlands:</hi> who were notwithſtanding (by a prohibition of all Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique with them, and the induſtry of Sir <hi>George Ayſcue</hi>'s Fleet,) within not many moneths, themſelves <hi>Nolens, volens,</hi> reduced to Conformity.</p>

                     <p>We find the <hi>Scotch</hi> King about the end of 1649, March 16, at <hi>Bredagh</hi> in the Netherlands, with whom the Scots there treated, and concluded, an utmoſt endeavour to re-inſtate him in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Throne over the three Nations; in order to which, June 6, 1650, he ſet forth from <hi>Holland,</hi> and landed in the North of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Engliſh ſhips lying in vain to intercept him.

Two Embaſſadours likewiſe come unto <hi>Stockholm</hi> at the ſame time, one from <hi>Portugal,</hi> another from the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> and by the mediation of <hi>Contarine</hi> the <hi>Venetian,</hi> are the former conditions confirmed with the King of <hi>Poland.</hi> With which <hi>Polonian, Chmielinsky</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> is the ſame year reconciled, having received the liberty of their Churches: yet the tumults of the Provinces do not altogether ceaſe, the Embaſſadours of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> bring themſelves with Pride and diſdain, into three Provinces, of which
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:33388:259"/>
                        <hi>Smolensko</hi> is Prince, and return with a title; and then the great Duke of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> was not called in letters as their friend, but as their Lord and Maſter, for which ſo unworthy actions, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours were impriſoned; nevertheleſſe an everlaſting peace is eſtabliſhed between them, although againſt the will of the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whoſe Cham or Emperour takes off the accuſtomed Tribute from the <hi>Polanders,</hi> that they uſed to pay him, on this condition, that there ſhould be a murual aid afforded when deſired, if the Turk ſhould invade either; by which Turk, a Tartar that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed unto the houſe of <hi>Ottaman,</hi> ſuffers a repulſe at Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>The ſaid Cham alſo tames and brings under the <hi>Cercaſsians,</hi> a people within his dominions that rebelled againſt him. But brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into the Kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> becauſe a Tyrant had now taken poſſeſſion of that induſtrious Kingdome, as going beyond his bounds, he is ſent forth (as we ſay) with a Flea in his Ear, being wholly expelled thence.</p>
                     <p>But the War between the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Turks waxeth hot in the year 1649. Two overthrows the <hi>Venetian</hi> gave him; one in the Haven of <hi>Foggio,</hi> where 72 Oar-Galleys periſhed, 18 bigger ſhips, 60 ſhips laden, 6000 Turks were ſlain together with the Baſhaw, taking as many more Priſoners. And this with the loſſe of but 90 <hi>Venetians,</hi> and 40 wounded.</p>
                     <p>This made the <hi>Sultan</hi> mad with rage, and he changes the Purple Garments of <hi>Saranzone,</hi> his Embaſſadour with others, into a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning weed; he caſts the Chriſtians into chains, and falls upon them with whips, but by the perſwaſion of the <hi>French</hi> Oratour, he is appeaſed. He alſo makes ſtop of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, and ſo returns unto his force againſt the <hi>Venetians:</hi> Who ſlew 1500 Turks at the Haven of <hi>Suda,</hi> drowning ſix Galleys, with the Baſhaw that was their chief Captain. They contend vehemently for <hi>Mocenige,</hi> 4000 Sacks ſtuffed with Wooll, and 33000 Scaling Ladders being brought thither for ſtorming, 'tis twice loſt, and as often recovered again, but at the third attempt, a Mine is made underground that conſumed 3000 Turks, and 200 Chriſtians. Twice were the Alps of Italy croſſed, into the lower <hi>Hungary,</hi> for prey.</p>
                     <p>And when <hi>Haaſe</hi> had given place unto <hi>Colorede,</hi> and had gone into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> 20000 Turks were there conſumed with the Plague. The Sultan could willingly have laid aſide <hi>Creet</hi> this year, but, yet he could not do it, becauſe of a <hi>Moſchee</hi> or Temple of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that he undertook there to conſecrate. However, more than fifty thouſand Chriſtians (ſo called) were Captivated by him.</p>
                     <p>The next year 1650, he is watchfull over the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who ſhewed their arms in a bravery againſt <hi>Babylon;</hi> and reneweth peace with the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> who the year before, becauſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:33388:260"/>of <hi>Germany</hi> would not grant them a war againſt him, upon the forgiving them a tribute of ſix hundred thouſand Royals, were willing to make a peace, and (as a token of their neighbourlineſſe) the number of ſome thouſands of Royals were to be reciprocally exchanged between them. He likewiſe redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the irregular <hi>Cyprians,</hi> and the Baſhaw of <hi>Cagre</hi> into order and obedience.</p>
                     <p>But in <hi>Candy,</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> affects him divers times with leſſe in the Gulph <hi>Del Vole:</hi> four times he was preyed upon, and the Haven of <hi>Maluaſe</hi> was ſtopt, together with victuall. Whereupon he moves in war by <hi>Ufais</hi> his Baſhaw, and that chiefly, becauſe his Navy at <hi>Dardanelle</hi> was penned up. Other Havens were alſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that proviſion could not be brought into the Iſland for relief of his garriſons; ſo that we will now leave the <hi>Venetians</hi> in their hopes, of having a moſt large ſurrender of that whole Iſland unto them.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1646, it was diſputed at Paris by <hi>Sarbona,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there ought to be one head of the Church, or whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there may be more; (this being a rare Controverſie among Catholiques, I here inſert it) which little book that reaſoned of the Point, the Pope whom it neerly touched, gives to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his Cardinals. The ſame year is alſo a book of one <hi>Oſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manne</hi> concerning Government, publiquely burnt at <hi>Agrippina</hi> of <hi>Colone;</hi> but in <hi>Wallersdorf</hi> at <hi>Glace,</hi> 109 perſons, with a noble wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with child, are ſtrangled by fire. In 1647, there was a kind of miraculous thing befell one <hi>James</hi> (a child of 7 years old) that was born at <hi>Modena,</hi> by reaſon of the tender greenneſſe of his years, who at that age diſputed, and that learnedly, of all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.

                     </head>
                     <p>AFter that (through <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s, the <hi>German</hi> Emperour, at the beginning of 1651, marrying <hi>Elenor</hi> Dutcheſſe of <hi>Mantua</hi> at <hi>Neoſtade,</hi> and <hi>Wolfgang</hi> Palatine of <hi>Neoburg,</hi> taking his third Wife <hi>Franciſca,</hi> daughter of <hi>Ego</hi> Earl of <hi>Furſtenburg</hi>) (all <hi>Germany</hi> being now pacified) the Courts and minds of the Princes were poured forth into Nuptial merriments, and by the late pacification, it was thought to be provided for the reſt and quiet of <hi>Germany;</hi> the beginning of a new War (by the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> entring into the <hi>Montian</hi> Dominion in hoſtile manner) ſuddenly aroſe: of which, though it were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and ſtraightway compoſed, yet this was the occaſion. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> Duke of <hi>Julia, Clivia,</hi> and <hi>Montia,</hi> &amp;c. marrying, in 1546, <hi>Mary</hi> the daughter of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the firſt, Emperour, obtained two priviledges of <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, Emperour; which were afterwards alſo confirmed by his ſucceſſours: Firſt, That if Duke <hi>William</hi> ſhould beget no heirs male of <hi>Mary,</hi> or being begotten, they ſhould depart life; all the right of the Dominions and Provinces, ſhould be devolved on the daughters begotten of them; or if none of them ſhould ſurvive, to the lawfull heirs male of the ſame. And then, that all thoſe ſaid Dominions ſhould remain undivided, with one onely univerſal Lord and Succeſſour: a cuſtome hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to obſerved by the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and many of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to confirm the ſtrength of power.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>William</hi> therefore, begetting two ſons, and four daughters; <hi>Charls Frederick,</hi> the elder, a Prince of great hope, dyed in 1577, in the flower of his age, at Rome. <hi>John</hi> the other ſon, (his father dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 1592) ſucceeded in his dominions. But being ſickly, and begetting no children of two wives, in 1599 left them (being dead) to be of divers Princes deſired. But by the Emperour's authority, the inheritance had regard to his ſiſters: the eldeſt of whom (married to the Duke of <hi>Boruſsia</hi>) dyed in 1608, before <hi>John,</hi> leaving one onely daughter, <hi>Anne,</hi> who afterward married <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> Electour of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> which is the Grandfather of the late Electour <hi>Frederick:</hi> whence the <hi>Brandenburgians</hi> derive their right to thoſe Provinces. The ſecond ſiſter marrying <hi>Philip</hi> Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> ſhe out-living her brother, and beautified with <hi>Wolfgang</hi> an heir male, ſeemed to be neareſt of all unto theſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. The third was given in marriage to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Bipont,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo ſons. The fourth marrying <hi>Charls</hi> Marqueſſe of <hi>Burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> the Palatine of <hi>Neoburg,</hi> paſſed over her right to himſelf by certain agreements. Therefore <hi>John</hi> dying, and others aſſerting
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:33388:261"/>their right by writing: <hi>Wolfgang</hi> the Neoburgian Palatinate, in his Mothers name; <hi>Erneſt</hi> Marqueſs of Brandenburg in the name of his brother the Electour <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> and his Wife, poſſeſſed thoſe empty Provinces: making an agreement at <hi>Tremonia</hi> the laſt of <hi>May,</hi> equally to govern the ſaid Province, till it ſhould be friendly by judgment decided of every one's right.</p>
                     <p>Then was it provided by the States of the Country, concerning Religion, and the exerciſe thereof, That the Roman Catholique, and other Chriſtian Religions, as ſpread abroad thorow the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire; ſo alſo in theſe Provinces, as to their publique ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, they be continued, and defended, nor that any one be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled therefore. But when as at that time, there was almoſt onely the exerciſe of the Catholique Religion, in all places of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, except a few, into which, about the laſt time of Duke <hi>William,</hi> and his ſon, againſt the Commands of the Princes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of new Religions had creeped: it came to paſſe, that by the winking and emulation of the new Princes of different Religion, new maſters were ſtrivingly brought in againſt the former Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and promiſes. But, the <hi>Neoburgian</hi> Palatine, leaving the <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtane,</hi> acknowledged the Roman Church openly in 1614. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed it at <hi>Duſseldorp,</hi> marrying <hi>Magdalene</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s daughter; beginning alſo to be much more diligently intent than before; that, what was agreed on in the beginning, the exerciſe of the Catholique Religion ſhould be obſerved in thoſe places, where it had been before; thoſe being ſent away and caſt out, who had been hitherto brought in againſt the Covenant, or hence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endeavoured to creep in. And that the rather, becauſe it was expreſly agreed in the <hi>Boruſsian</hi> and <hi>Neoburgian</hi> marriages; that if the inheritance of theſe dominions ſhould chance to come to the above mentioned daughters: there ſhould be no innovation: but the Catholique Religion retained without any obſtacle. But the <hi>Brandenburgians</hi> thought it neither hindered the nuptial Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, nor the State's promiſe, if the followers of other Religions, than what was uſual, was brought in; ſo it might be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wronging the Catholiques, and they among theſe do live quietly and peaceably: moreover, it made for the no leſſe quiet of the conſcience, than of the Common-wealth, ſeeing 'tis a thing uncomely, and diverſe from the worthineſſe of a Prince, That no exerciſe of his own Religion, ſhould be lawfull in his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, (which Religion is onely one) whoſe likeneſſe and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may breed love to them, and the reverence of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. This diverſeneſſe of opinions increaſed, after they divided the Provinces betwixt them, and the contention came even ſo far, that the States of <hi>Holland</hi> intermingled them; and to affright the <hi>Neoburgian</hi> from his purpoſe, what they could, (by their Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the neighbouring Cities of <hi>Rheinberck</hi> and <hi>Orſoy,</hi> led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives the pariſh Prieſts, and religious perſons out of the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>Montia</hi> and <hi>Julia;</hi> and held them ſome years in hard cuſtody; in which alſo, ſome were conſumed with grief and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:33388:262"/>plainly harmleſſe, and without the like game, danger, and controverſie: whence it came to paſſe, that many Catholique pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh prieſts fleeing for fear, their ſubjects long wanted the exerciſe of divine worſhip: and many Infants departed this life without baptiſm; perſons of riper age without Confeſſion and the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. Therefore, the <hi>Neoburgian,</hi> that he might deliver himſelf and ſubjects from theſe difficuities: after letters ſent, and Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to and from <hi>Camerarius Burgſtorff,</hi> chief man with the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> in the year 1647, he thus concluded Apr. 8. about Religion, and its exerciſe, at <hi>Duſseldorp:</hi> That the Churches, and their goods and revenues ſhould be reſtored to thoſe that poſſeſſed them in the year 1609; but both the publique and private exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Religion without the Churches, ſhould be in that manner as it had been in any part of the year 1612. Moreover, it was confirmed by the Electour: and Deputies ſent from either Prince, who begin the execution of the ſaid tranſaction. But here again the action ſtuck. The <hi>Brandenburgians</hi> would not go back from a promiſcuous uſe of Religion, and that in the ſtrength of the firſt Reverſals. The <hi>Neoburgians</hi> contended (on the contrary) that they muſt of neceſſity inſiſt on this tranſaction, which had been taken up as a moderating of the ſaid Reverſals, of whoſe meaning hitherto the Princes could not agree. So they departed, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter un-ended. But the <hi>Neoburgian,</hi> when as not long after, a whole pacification was ended in <hi>Germany,</hi> becauſe the particular tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions did not proceed, he fleeth to the obſervance of that; and for reſtoring Religion and its exerciſe, he took the year 1624 gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally preſcribed in that pacification, in example of the other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who now began to conſult of that in many places throughout the Empire. Amongſt theſe things, the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> in this year 1651, talking with the Electour of <hi>Saxony</hi> a few dayes in <hi>Liechtenburgh</hi> Caſtle, went to <hi>Clive,</hi> ſending ſome Armies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which he had drawn out of his garriſons, and others to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after; over all which he had placed <hi>Otto Sparrius,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all, almoſt 4000. A Command was publiſhed at <hi>Clive,</hi> June the 15th, in the Electour's name, and ſtraightway faſtened on ſome places, in the Dukedoms of <hi>Montia</hi> and <hi>Julia,</hi> to their States and Inhabitants; The Electour firſt ſignifying, he came into thoſe Provinces, that he might reſtore their liberty and priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, into the ancient place and vigour, according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and promiſes entred into by their Anceſtors, againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers injuries of the <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Neoburg;</hi> and in order hereto it was needful, that one place or other be poſſeſſed where he might faſten his foot. Where none ought to interpret that thing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than he thinketh, ſince it is not his purpoſe, to ſeek any other than the glory of God, the ſafety of his Countrey, and Juſtice, which he would have imparted to all and every one, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their Religion, according to the Covenants and tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of former years. And then, he commanded all Governours and Inhabitants of theſe Dukedomes, that hence-forward they
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:33388:262"/>decree or pay not any contributions to the Palatine of <hi>Neoburg,</hi> afford him no ayd, by counſel or deed, but that they reſpect and obſerve him and his heirs onely. At laſt he threateneth, if any one ſhall go on to reſiſt this Edict, or ſhall help the <hi>Neoburgian</hi> by any means, he (taking away all his priviledges) ſhall hold him for an enemy and Rebel. The ſame day of his Edicts divulging, the Electour's Souldiers attempted <hi>Angermond</hi> Caſtle, by ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and caſting in many granadoes, ſome Citizens and others being ſlain at the firſt onſet, and then, when the Caſtle made ſtronger reſiſtance than they had hoped, the ſtreet being plundred, and the adjacent Temple, the ſpoylers go thorow the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places with the ſame force. And in the Temple of the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage <hi>Mulchem,</hi> not being content to have robbed that, they ſlay an Infant in its Mother's arms, by cleaving its head. Thence to the Village <hi>Pempelfurt,</hi> in the ſight of <hi>Duſseldorp,</hi> and the very Forts, coming to the Village, driving away all the Princes herds, and leſſer cattel, they ſpoyl as much as they might for the time, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing threatnings of ſpeedy coming with a greater Army and forces. In the mean time, the Electour had ſent to the Emperour to purge or acquit himſelf, explaining the cauſes of this his action againſt the Palatine, which for brevity ſake I forbear here particularly to ſet down. But the Palatine openly proteſting by a writing of the force and wrong brought on him: refuted alſo what things were publiſhed againſt him in the Electour's name, by a contrary writing: and then ſent to ſolicite <hi>Leopold</hi> the Arch-Duke, and <hi>Charls</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> for ayd, to repell the unthought of war: ſending alſo to <hi>Vienna,</hi> perfectly to inform the Emperour of all things, and require help againſt unjuſt force. And having firſt purged himſelf to <hi>Caeſar</hi> of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> his accuſation, he confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it by a divulged writing. And (the while) muſters Souldiers throughout all his Dominions, over whom he placed <hi>John Baro</hi> of <hi>Reuſchenberg,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> returning out of <hi>Brabant,</hi> brought a part of the <hi>Lorrain</hi> Army.</p>

<pb n="512" facs="tcp:33388:263"/>(Provincial) of the Princes, and if indeed, it ſhall ſeem to be this laſt; how thoſe Covenants are to be underſtood and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. But if (for the equalneſſe of voices) the Commiſſioners can determine nothing; The Emperour, ſome head men of the Empire being taken into counſell, alike in number, of either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or in the next aſſembly for Election, ſhall decide and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the whole controverſy by the ſame; and they ſhall ſtand to that judgment without further contradiction, by force of the late publick pacification; but (the mean time) all things ſhall be reſtored into that ſtate in which they were before theſe ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, nor ſhall any one be troubled for Religion. And then, ſhall neither, for the future, wage war on other, even under any pretence, and that under penalty, of violating the peace, and the loſſe of all rights, which any one pretendeth to theſe dominions; but ſhall let go controverſies hence-forward to ariſe, to a friendly compoſure, and judiciall ſentence.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Priſoners on both ſides ſhall be let go, and Armies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe which are needfull to the guarding of the body, or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons of places, neither ſhall it be for any one by deceit of either party, to be preſent by counſell or help at theſe ſhakings. But other things which concern the ſtate-Politick, ſhall ſo remain, as it hath been agreed in divers tranſactions between the Princes, yet without prejudice and deceit of all, who pretend to the <hi>Juliacan</hi> ſucceſſion. Theſe things being thus finiſhed, and ſealed to, they ſtraightway depart from Arms.</p>
                     <p>But after that <hi>Charls Stuart</hi> was at or about the beginning of Jan. 1650 Crowned King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at <hi>Shoone,</hi> the uſuall place of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Coronations, (which Moneth, as I have ſaid, beginneth the 1651 year of the Germane Account) in a ſolemn aſſembly of the heads of that Kingdome, among which ceremonies; <hi>Robert Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſse</hi> gratifying him with a prepared Oration or ſpeech; exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him (from the opinion of them all, to revenge his fathers death) he ſpent all his time in warlike preparations; and, as ſoon as the ſeaſon of the year permitted, came into the field againſt General <hi>Cromwell.</hi> The Scots began to be both powerfull and numerous by reaſon of an agreement now pieced up of many parties and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions there, and having compleated their levies to 15000 foot, and 6000 Horſe, they faced the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Torwood,</hi> but would not engage them, encamping behind inacceſſible places to delay the ſame. Wherefore the <hi>Engliſh</hi> landing 1600 Foot, and four Troops of Horſe, at Queens Ferry, into Fife (loſing but about ſix men) July the 17th 1651; the Scots ſent four thouſand to drive them out of Fife. Whereupon the Generall, ſending four Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Horſe and Foot to joyn with the other, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the enemy by aſcending the Hill, routed the Scots, ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about 2000, and taking 1400, <hi>Brown</hi> the chief Commander being one; few of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſlain, though many wounded. Then was there an additional ſtrength ſent into Fife, and ſtrong <hi>Inchigarney</hi> Caſtle there, ſurrendred, July the 25th after, and
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:33388:263"/>ſoon after that, <hi>Brunt-Iſland</hi> (with all its Proviſions &amp;c. onely the ſouldiers to march away with Colours flying, &amp;c.) was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army; of much concernment, as ſtoring them with all neceſſaries. Thence Marching to St. <hi>Johns</hi> Town of great ſtrength, it was alſo ſoon yielded unto them. But the Scotch King (fearing leaſt his Army ſhould moulder away with daily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triments, and rather willing to transfer the War into <hi>England,</hi> ſlipt in thither by the way of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> comming to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> Aug. the 22th with about 16000 Horſe and Foot; (an undertaking ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from neceſſity and deſpair, then mature deliberation, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by a brief letter of Duke <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> taken amongſt other Papers) yet animated thereto by a notable deſign of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters with the Scots; who being offended with the new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, now favoured the Kings cauſe.</p>
                     <p>This deſign was for a generall riſing in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and adjacent parts, the Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> to come out of the Iſle of <hi>Man,</hi> and raiſe the Countrey, who joyning with the Scotch forces, ſhould confront the Parliaments greateſt power. The chief promoters hereof in <hi>England,</hi> were ſeverall perſons (now too tedious to relate particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly) meeting at <hi>Chriſtopher Love's</hi> houſe, a Presbyterian Miniſter, who (by his own Narrative) was privy thereto after the breaking off of the Treaty between the King and the Scots at <hi>Jerſey,</hi> which being ſeaſonably diſcovered, and the grand Agent <hi>Thomas Cook,</hi> apprehended, and after eſcape, retaken, March 30. 1651. Major General <hi>Harriſon</hi> (after the ſeizing of one <hi>Birkenhead</hi> another Agent) was by the Parliament ordered to March Northward with Horſe and Foot, to prevent riſings, and oppoſe the Scotch Army if they ſhould enter England: <hi>Love</hi> himſelf with others being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; he was arraigned before <hi>Englands</hi> High-Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, June 21. 1651, ſentenced July the fifth, and on the 15th day being reprieved for 28 dayes, was with one <hi>Gibbons</hi>) another act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our therein) beheaded on Tower-Hill, Auguſt the 22th follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>The King comming to <hi>Worceſter</hi> was proclaimed King of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> thought to take his journey ſtraight to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> which made the City tremble. But while he ſtayeth there to refreſh his ſouldiers (a few daies) wearied with their journeys toyl, <hi>Cromwells</hi> ſpeedy expedition, prevented his counſell; who leaving <hi>Monk</hi> with 7000 in <hi>Scotland</hi> (who took in ſix ſtrong holds there, with ſeverall others) came to <hi>Worceſter</hi> before he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of his adverſaries, and after about an hours ſharp diſpute of the Kings party, in oppoſing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> paſſage over Severn, they giving ground, maintained with about three Regiments, another hot diſpute at <hi>Powick</hi> bridge: but at length ran into <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter:</hi> whom the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as Conquerours, following, they drew out what they could, making a reſolute ſally: where after a little retiring of the Generalls men, the enemy was totally routed, their works taken, the Town entred and ſacked, about 10000 were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in all, and about 3000 were ſlain.</p>
                     <pb n="514" facs="tcp:33388:264"/>
                     <p>Amongſt the many of quality, Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> (being wounded) fell into his enemies hands, dying next day of his wounds: hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py (as one ſaith) in this, that by a timely death, he eſcaped the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Axe. The King fleeing, and leaving his fellows, whoſe faith he ſuſpected in ſuch ſtraits, gets with one Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> into a hollow Tree next day till night: and ſo in diſguiſed habit and hair cut, by the aſſiſtance of a Lady, (whether comming to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> firſt or not) got over into <hi>France,</hi> 500 <abbr>l.</abbr> being offered to any one that ſhould detect him.</p>
                     <p>This defeat was on Sept. the third, 1651. when as a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Aug. 23. the ſaid Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> landing with about 300 in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> had ſoon encreaſed them to 1500, he was by Colonel <hi>Lilburn,</hi> with his onely Regiment in an hours time routed; many of note taken and ſlain, with all their baggage, &amp;c. the Earl him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf recovering <hi>Worceſter,</hi> but was afterwards taken by the ſaid <hi>Lilburn,</hi> and Octob. 15. following, beheaded at <hi>Bolton,</hi> as was alſo Sir <hi>Tho.

                     <p>The Captives, whom for number the Priſons would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, being diverſly diſpoſed of, a great part were ſent away into <hi>America.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo were apprehended moſt of the Nobility and Gentry of that Nation, as they were aſſembled to propagate their King's intereſt. So that <hi>Scotland</hi> being after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Armies paſſage into Fife, with little difficulty ſubdued: Commiſſioners were ſent from the Parliament at <hi>London</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to receive thoſe that had yielded themſelves into their defence and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Four very conſiderable places fell this year 1651. into the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Englands</hi> power, as additionalls to their ſucceſſe. The one was <hi>Scilly</hi> Iſlands, a great annoyance to Merchant-men of the Common-wealth, for reducing whereof, Gen. <hi>Blake</hi> ſet ſail, Apr. 18. which were ſurrendred Jun. 2. following. Another was the Iſle of <hi>Man,</hi> for which end, three Foot Regiments were ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Lever-pool,</hi> Octob. 16. who although they were on the eighteenth day driven into <hi>Beumorris</hi> by contrary winds: Yet, ſayling thence the 28th day, they had aſſurance by an Iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of landing without any oppoſition, (which facility recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed their former difficulty) all being ſecured for them but two Caſtles, <hi>Ruſhen,</hi> and <hi>Peel,</hi> which (they beſieging) were delivered on low terms without any bloud-ſhed Oct. 26. Colonel <hi>Hain</hi> alſo, ſetting ſail for <hi>Jerſey,</hi> Octob. 19. and after ſome difficulty, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition received in landing, all was ſoon reduced but <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Caſtle, which held out till the middle of December, whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, Sir <hi>George Carteret,</hi> had large conditions, for the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtrength and ſcituation thereof.</p>
                     <p>The laſt was <hi>Cornet</hi>-Caſtle in the Iſle of <hi>Guernſey,</hi> even an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:33388:264"/>place; which although being before attempted by ſtorm, divers were ſlain, and ſome drowned in getting off, yet in the Moneth of November, was ſurrendred on compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament about this time, ſetting forth an Act for increaſe of Shipping, and encouragement of Navigation; to the perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which was conteined in four particulars, they ſent their Embaſſadours to <hi>London,</hi> who came thither De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemb. the 17th and had audience the nineteenth. But becauſe they could not procure the repealing of that Act eſpecially; they aſſayed to do it by force. Two Embaſſadours were likewiſe ſent into <hi>Holland</hi> out of <hi>England</hi> March 11. who though they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at <hi>Roterdam,</hi> yet were ſeverall times affronted.</p>
                     <p>On Jan. 11. this year, was the <hi>Barbado's</hi> ſurrendred to Sir <hi>George Ayſcough,</hi> in the Parliaments behalf. And <hi>John Lilburn</hi> Jan 15. was ſentenced to baniſhment about the buſineſſe of Sir <hi>Arthur Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlerig,</hi> which was executed on him by an act made to that purpoſe on the thirtieth day of the ſame Month. 1651.</p>
                     <p>And to conclude this year in <hi>England,</hi> an Act of general Pardon and Oblivion came forth from the Parliament, Febr. 24. 1651, that ill-will and rancour might be buried as to former differences and offences before Sept. 3. of the ſame year; and although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were thereby (at the preſent) cleared at Aſſizes, &amp;c. for divers offences; yet many things beſides murther were left unpardoned: neither was the ſtomach of many in that Common-wealth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by allayed, as afterwards appeared.</p>
                     <p>But in <hi>France,</hi> after that the Princes were ſet at liberty, (and the baniſhed Cardinal, after ſome movings, came into the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick of <hi>Colonia,</hi> ſeating his dwelling at <hi>Brule</hi> in the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop's Caſtle) they coming to the King and Queen; that there might be a greater confidence of a reconciliation, the Lievtenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Aquitane</hi> is offered to the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> (this in 1651,) the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> renouncing it of his own accord: whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment the <hi>Burgedalians,</hi> obſtinately enough, ſpake ill of; and unleſſe he laid down his Lievtenantſhip, they threatned new ſtirs.</p>
                     <p>The King, in the mean time, entring into the 14th year of his age, came forth from under the tuition of the Queen his Mother, in the moneth Septemb. of the ſame year: where (in the higheſt Court of the chief ones of all ranks or ſtates aſſembled, with all the King's Senate; likewiſe the Duke of <hi>Orleance, Andegave, York,</hi> and the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> the King's Aunt) the King having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven brief thanks to the Queen his Mother, in that for ſo many years ſhe had governed the Kingdom with great care and pains, is placed in a Chair of Eſtate, and begins his Kingly functions. Firſt of all the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was quitted, (being abſent); for, that he might not be preſent at this action, he had few dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore departed from <hi>Paris.</hi> Then was confirmed the Senate's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree for the Cardinal's departure. Some favours (alſo) being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:33388:265"/>among the Peers: amongſt other things, the care of the King's Seal was committed to the chief Man of the Senate, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Tholouſe.</hi> Moreover, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> going into his own Province of <hi>Aquitane,</hi> the minds of the <hi>Burdegalians</hi> being in friendſhip with him, muſters new Armies; many of the Court and Nobility following him; by whoſe favour and wealth, when he had drawn both all <hi>Aquitane,</hi> and <hi>Santonie,</hi> with the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cities, it appeared, that he undoubtedly attempted a new War. The King endeavoureth, with the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> and the Senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> to appeaſe <hi>Conde,</hi> that laying down his arms, he might ſit down quiet in his own Province. When that could not be obtained, he alſo preparing arms, condemns <hi>Conde</hi> of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and leaving <hi>Paris,</hi> ſpeedily goes to <hi>Pictave,</hi> ſpeedily calling back the Cardinal, who, the while, had enrolled ſome forces for this event. Therefore about the end of the year, the Cardinal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns into <hi>France</hi> with an Army; the Senate of <hi>Paris</hi> much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching, That the decree againſt the Cardinal might be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued.</p>
                     <p>Thus that moſt flouriſhing Kingdom being divided into facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, deſtroyes its ſelf with its own forces; and the next year 1652, Civil diſcords more cruelly burned out, <hi>Condy</hi> and <hi>Orleance,</hi> with the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> urging by force of arms the Cardinal's paſſe-port, and the Decree's execution againſt him. He being ſupported (on the contrary) by the King and Queens defence ſtiffly defends by arms, the dignity of the King's authority againſt the force and power of the alike contenders. But, what will at length be the iſſue hereof, following years will make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</p>
                     <p>This year alſo 1651, brought forth a notable Victory to the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> againſt the <hi>Coſsacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars.</hi> For the <hi>Coſsacks</hi> not being contented with the peace made a year or two before, kept an Army in the field; and not containing themſelves within their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bounds, they hindered not the <hi>Taurican Tartars</hi> going into <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachia;</hi> but defended them with all their ayd, againſt which, the agreement was. But when the <hi>Polonians</hi> in ſo doubtful affairs, ſate down with part of their Army, beneath <hi>Camenece</hi> in <hi>Podolia,</hi> to defend their own borders: nor could bring help to the Duke of <hi>Walachia</hi> their confederate, for fear of the <hi>Coſsacks:</hi> yet they bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Polonians,</hi> as if they provided arms againſt them, and muſtered the whole Souldiery of their Kingdom, onely utterly to deſtroy and blot out them. Therefore <hi>Chimelinsky</hi> ſending Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, firſt to <hi>Potoccie</hi> the Lievtenant General, who was at <hi>Camenece,</hi> and afterwards to the King: They required, that the Army might be led out of <hi>Podolia</hi> and their borders: who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them, They ſhould return to their own, and leave the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Walachia;</hi> that there was no evill to be feared from them, while they ſtood to their Covenants, and maintained the peace. But they continued holding up arms, and to help <hi>Polana</hi>'s enemies: the cauſe was, That being careful of their own defence,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:33388:265"/>they might look to their own affairs, and ſee that the Common-wealth took no damage. Then at Aſſemblies which the King had ſumoned about the end of the former year, an Embaſſage was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to the <hi>Coſsacks,</hi> to denounce peace, if they obeyed; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, war: and alſo for that war, if there were need, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Charges and common Cuſtoms, and that 36000 for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Souldiers ſhould be entertained, beſides thoſe Armies that were in the Kingdom, and that it ſhould be in the King's power, when there was need, to call all the Nobility to arms, and ſo to meet the enemy with all the forces of the Kingdom. The Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies ended, the King deſigned ſix <hi>Poland</hi> Peers to go to <hi>Kiove</hi> in Embaſſage to the <hi>Coſsacks;</hi> and that being in vain, he bent his mind to provide for Arms; ſending away thoſe thorow <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> who ſhould muſter what Army they could, and at firſt of the Spring, ſhould bring them to him beneath <hi>Lubline,</hi> with his whole Nobility which he was ſpeedily to call forth, ready fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and provided. <hi>Chimelensky</hi> hearing of the iſſue of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, prepared himſelf no leſſe ſlowly for an imminent war. Neither onely entring into fellowſhip with the <hi>Tartars;</hi> but alſo he had ſent diſpatched Meſſengers to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Turkiſh Governours, and into <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> for ayd. Some of whom being intercepted, diſcovered his wonderful counſels and cruel attempts againſt <hi>Poland.</hi> Therefore in the beginning of the Spring, <hi>Chimilensky,</hi> paſſing over <hi>Boryſthenes,</hi> led 140000 (among whom were 12000 <hi>Taurican Tartars,</hi> whom as yet 40000 others were to follow) into <hi>Volynia,</hi> and there, poſſeſſing ſome places, pitched his Camps. The <hi>Polanders</hi> in the mean time, <hi>Calinovius</hi> being their Leader, take <hi>Vinnicia,</hi> a famous City of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolia,</hi> and kill all the <hi>Coſsacks</hi> therein. Which ſlaughter haſtened <hi>Chimelinskies</hi> coming out of <hi>Volynia,</hi> where he had alſo forcibly taken by the way <hi>Bialakaercave,</hi> ſo that he moved with his whole Army againſt <hi>Calinovius:</hi> who being unequall to ſo great forces, recovered <hi>Camenece;</hi> and leaving a ſufficient Garriſon there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf to the King, who having paſſed over the River <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> at <hi>Socale,</hi> expected the <hi>Polonian</hi> Nobility, and the <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Army. <hi>Chmielensky</hi> having endeavoured in vain to ſtay <hi>Calinovius</hi> going back, with ſmall fights, attempted <hi>Camenece</hi> with ſome on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets; but being alwayes repulſed with the great ſlaughter of his Soldiers, he at length ſate down pitching his tents at <hi>Conſtantinovia:</hi> which place is diſtant almoſt 15 miles from <hi>Camenece,</hi> between the borders of <hi>Volynia</hi> and <hi>Podolia.</hi> Moreover, the King, after that his Nobility and the other Armies came together, his Army being increaſed to almoſt 100000; moving from <hi>Socale,</hi> he led it againſt the enemy. Neither did <hi>Chmielensky</hi> ſhift off the fight, now more fierce, becauſe the Emperour of <hi>Tartars</hi> himſelf had a little before, entred in his Camp with the moſt choyſe of his Souldiers. And then he far exceeded the <hi>Polonians</hi> in number: for if credit be to be given to thoſe who have written of his Camp, it was to the number of 300000. Therefore both Armies mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:33388:266"/>forward, they came together at the Town <hi>Bereſteck.</hi> The firſt onſet on the <hi>Polander</hi>'s Camp was made by 10000 <hi>Tartars, June</hi> 28, who being repulſed with ſlaughter, the Emperour himſelf next day, with all his <hi>Tartars,</hi> and part of the <hi>Coſsacks,</hi> aſſaulted the <hi>Polander</hi>'s Army with great force: and that battle endured, untill night withdrew the fighters. This two dayes battle was a flouriſhing skirmiſh before the general fight; and as yet, their forces were in danger of departing from each other with a mutual fear. On the third day therefore, which was the laſt of <hi>June,</hi> the whole Army met, and that with ſuch force and ſtiffneſſe on both ſides, that it long remained doubtful which ſide ſhould have the victory. At laſt, the <hi>Polanders</hi> ſtrength overcame, who, when they had made their firſt aſſault on the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and had driven them from their ſtanding, their flight very much troubled the <hi>Coſsacks</hi> Army. So the moſt numerous Army being ſcattered and put to flight, left a moſt ample victory to the <hi>Polonians.</hi> The King a little before evening, in the very place where the battle was fought, gave thanks to God, the Conquerour of enemies, ſinging a ſolemn hymn of thanks: which, a mixt ſound (with terrout) of great Guns and Trumpets, did diſtinguiſh with an acceptable mean or temper.</p>
                     <p>The day after, it is told the King, a very great multitude of enemies, which eſcaped in flight, as yet ſtood, and fenced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a fit and fenny place, ſetting their Carts and baggage on the ſides of them, of which they had a great number. <hi>Chmielensky</hi> was in that place, waiting for an occaſion to be given him, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging himſelf. The King, ſeeing he could not (by reaſon of the place) drive them out thence by force; he appointed, that (all wayes being ſtopped up) no proviſion might be brought unto them: which thing, drave the beſieged almoſt to deſperation, but that they had as yet one paſſage: thorow which, when (all their victuals being ſpent) on the 10th day after, they had diſorderly poured forth themſelves, many of them were ſlain by the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> following on them: Some alſo were ſupt up in the Fens and Pools, the bridges breaking which they (in this neceſſity, and want of matter) had ſewed together of skins. In this flight, there periſhed to the number of 20000: and amongſt them, the Greek Patriarch, ſent from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to encourage the <hi>Coſsacks</hi> to this war. This victory being gotten, the <hi>Poland</hi> Nobility, although the King very much exhorred them to proſecute the victory, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (at length) their leave, departed home. The other Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were hired for reward, were ſent to follow after them that fled. <hi>Janus Ratzvil,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Souldiery, following with his men to <hi>Boryſthenes,</hi> took in <hi>Kiove,</hi> once the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-City of all <hi>Ruſsia,</hi> and <hi>Monilove,</hi> with other Cities ſituated on this ſide and beyond <hi>Boryſthenes,</hi> by force or ſurrender. <hi>Chmie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensky</hi> therefore being afflicted with ſo many diſcommodities, and fearing greater, is again compelled to deſire peace. Which was granted him by the chief Governours of the <hi>Polonian</hi> warfare,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:33388:266"/>(their Armies daily diminiſhing with infection) on theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Firſt of all, a common to leration of Religion is granted, a return of them that were expelled, into their countrey, and a granting them their goods; pardon was granted to all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed this war, and to <hi>Chmielensky</hi> himſelf; yet ſo, that comming to the next publique aſſemblies, he ſhould in humble manner beſeech the King: neither henceforward ſhould have more then 20000 <hi>Coſsacks</hi> under his banners, with whom he being tied by oath to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> he ſhould defend the borders of his Kingdome againſt the inroads of the <hi>Tartars, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and to diſſolve what leagues he had with the <hi>Polanders</hi> enemies; and hereafter perform faith and obedience to the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>

To the making famous this act, which <hi>Colonia</hi> had not ſeen a hundred years before, and the more fitly to behold the Majeſty of the Rites of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, there was prepared in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Cathedrall, a place made of boards between the chief Pillars, and fenced with wooden railes, and on every ſide ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with moſt pretious Arras-hangings, which the Guard men with Launces encompaſſed to reſtrain the multitude; in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of that place was built a Theatre on high with three ſteps, embracing almoſt the ſpace of two Pillars, and ſpread with red cloath, for the chief Altar which was ſeen in its front towards the Eaſt: the Altar alſo being higher then the Theatre by three ſteps, Silver Images of the twelve Apoſtles, and in the midſt of the ſame, a very great Silver Croſſe (once the gift of <hi>Pilgrime</hi> Arch-Biſhop) beautified it. At the right part of the Altar to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, was raiſed up the Arch-Biſhops chair, and a little beneath it, four ſeats for the Princes, the <hi>Neoburgian, Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> and his Wife, and the Earl of <hi>Furſtemburg</hi> his Widow, &amp;c.

                     <p>The ſame year 1652, produced a bloudy Sea-war between <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glands</hi> Republick, and the ſtates of the United Provinces; for theſe (through divers years proſperity and induſtry in Maritime affairs, although it was truly obſerved by <hi>Keckerman</hi> in his time: <hi>Hoc certum eſt omnibus hodie gentibus navigandi induſtria et peritia, Superiores eſse Anglos, poſt Anglos Belgas, et inter hos, Flandros, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landos, Zelandos. This is ſure</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that of all Nations at this day, the</hi> Engliſh <hi>are chief in the diligence and skillfulneſſe of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; after them, the</hi> Belgians; <hi>and amongſt theſe, the</hi> Flandrians, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, <hi>and</hi> Zelanders) ſo increaſed in ſtrength at Sea, that they durſt diſpute their quarrel in divers bloudy encounters with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> refuſing to ſtrike their top-ſail in the narrow-Seas, <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glands</hi> right of Soveraignty there; as alſo denying to pay the tenth Herring (caught by them in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seas) to the new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, refuſing alſo not to afford refuge or help to the houſe of the <hi>Stewards</hi> in their Provinces as was demanded; and to give ſatisfaction for dammage brought by them on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the Indies, which amounted to above 1000000 <abbr>lb</abbr> ſterling, and for hereafter to be cautious of not offending, and alſo to ſuffer the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> to ſail freely and ſafely on the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Sea, with ſome other ſuch like. An Embaſſadour indeed from <hi>Holland</hi> had audience, but departed out of <hi>England</hi> without any compoſure of differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces June 30. For while they were upon a Treaty, <hi>Vantrump</hi> the Dutch Admiral comming with 42 Sail of Ships (nigh the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> ſhore, towards <hi>Dover</hi> road) to view, refuſed to ſtrike his Sail, and hung out a Red flag, the ſignal of his Fleet, giving the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Generall <hi>Blake</hi> a broad ſide; Whoſe Navies encountring each other about four hours ſpace; one Dutch Ship was ſunk, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taken, with their Captains, and about 150 Priſoners. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet having about ten ſlain, and fourty wounded, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving little hurt, but in the Admirals Maſts, Sails, and rigging, with many ſhot in her Hull. This was May 19. 1652, and was the beginning of almoſt two years War, in which, the firſt fight after was made by Sir <hi>George Ayſcough</hi> (returning ſome Weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from reducing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations) in July, who with
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:33388:267"/>his Squadron of Ships, took, burnt and diſperſed 30 or 36 Dutch ſhips, and Auguſt 16 following, fought them near <hi>Plymouth.</hi> But three terrible Sea-fights were betwixt the two Nations (beſides others) in that ſpace of time. The one, Febr. 18, 1652, near the Iſle of Wight and Portland, wherein the Dutch were worſted. Another was June 2, and 3, 1653, where they were alſo worſted; but with the loſſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> General, <hi>Dean:</hi> who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards pompouſly buried at Weſtminſter. The third and laſt, and ſaddeſt conflict, but moſt ſeaſonable victory to the Engliſh, was July 29, and 30, 1653, wherein their Admiral <hi>Vantrump</hi> was ſlain, and their Fleet alſo worſted, about 30 Men of War being ſunk and fired, and about 1000 priſoners, with 6 Captains taken out of their ſinking ſhips. Yet Gen. <hi>Blake</hi> himſelf was ſomewhat put to the worſt in Decemb. 1652, which made the Dutch rejoyce and inſult; and in the <hi>Levant</hi> Seas, toward the latter end of the ſame year, five conſiderable Engliſh ſhips were taken and blown up by the Dutch alſo.</p>
                     <p>There was alſo ſeveral Tranſactions between the Engliſh and the Daniſh King; who refuſed to deliver ſome Merchants ſhips, that (to avoid the danger of the Dutch then in the Sound) had put themſelves under his protection; 18 ſayl ſet forth from North-Yarmouth Sept. 19. 1652, to convoy them home; and on the 26 day received a Letter from the King, That he would ſecure them for the Merchants as he had done; but would not deliver them unto them: whereupon they (as deſtitute of hope) left their Ships and came home with this Fleet.

                     <p>A little before which time, were the ſpirits and expectations of ſome <hi>Scots</hi> heightned, partly through promiſes which their King made them by his Agents; and partly through the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of divers perſons in <hi>England;</hi> ſo that under the command of the Earls of <hi>Glencarn</hi> and <hi>Kenmore,</hi> was an Army raiſed in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of 4000 horſe and foot; who Rendezvouzing at the <hi>Lough,</hi> Colonel <hi>Morgan</hi> with about 1500 horſe and foot there wholly routed them, Febr. 17. 1653, and ſlew about 150 of them.

And on the very morning of this execution-day, were the Articles of Peace (now fully concluded betwixt <hi>England</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi>) ſigned by the ſame Embaſſadour; who immediately withdrew out of the City.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe in the Highlands of <hi>Scotland</hi> (being not as yet diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and receiving ſome additionall ſtrength from <hi>Middleton</hi> who had landed there out of <hi>Holland,</hi> as chief Generall for the young King) were quickly again reputed an Army, againſt whom Generall Monk being ſent, and in thoſe High-lands attending their motions in ſeverall Marches from June the ninth, 1654, unto July 29 following, he by degrees totally defeated them: <hi>Middleton</hi> himſelf being neceſſitated to flee and take ſhipping out of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and his ſcattered forces daily repairing unto the Garriſons of <hi>Englands</hi> Common-Wealth for mercy.</p>

                     <p>In the mean time, the Protectour, his Councill, and Army Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, were imployed at home, in ſuppreſſing a diſcovered Plot, and inſurrections in divers places; for it was certified from <hi>York</hi> unto <hi>London, March</hi> 26, 1655, that one Sir <hi>Richard Maliverer,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting his Tenants a few nights before, unto a Supper, incited them to joyn in Arms with him; who (with others) intended to ſeize on the City of <hi>York</hi> the ſame night for King <hi>Charls,</hi> appointing them a Gate where he would meet them: and going with four of them unto <hi>Heſsay</hi> Moor, divers chief of the Country met them, with Carts laden with Arms; yet the appearance being too ſmall, they diſperſed again. Wherefore, the ſaid <hi>Maliverer</hi> was neceſſitated to flee beyond the Seas. There were ſome ſaid to be riſen about <hi>Merioneth ſhire,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Wales:</hi> againſt whom, ſome other Inhabitants roſe to joyn in oppoſing them. Another party reported 500, (though not ſo many) roſe in <hi>Nottinghamſhire;</hi> whom from Colonel <hi>Hacker,</hi> a party marched out of <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe. <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> Caſtle was to be poſſeſſed by a ſtratagem of two men going into the Caſtle in womens apparrell, and two other as their men to wait on them, &amp;c. of which the Governour having notice, prevented the deſign. The City of <hi>Cheſter</hi> being likewiſe intended to be ſeized on. But that of moſt dangerous conſequence to the peace of the Common-wealth was, the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection at and about <hi>Salisbury</hi> in <hi>wiltſhire,</hi> beginning March 12. for the Judges coming into <hi>Saliſbury</hi> on Saturday night from <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> Aſſizes; ſome (for King <hi>Charls</hi>) came into the Town alſo, as being a time of leaſt ſuſpition: and rendezvouzing the next day, in the night were above an hundred; the chief Commander being one Sir <hi>Joſeph wagſtaffe:</hi> who on Munday morning early, ſeizing all horſes, ſeized alſo on the Sheriff the ſame morning, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to force him to proclaim <hi>Charls Stuart</hi> King: and wounding and knocking him over the head with a piſtol for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of the ſame; and carrying him away. They plundred alſo both the Judges, Sheriff, Juſtices, and others, of all that was fit to carry away: yet did the Judges no harm in their perſons; but, taking away their Paroll, they let out both priſoners for debt, and alſo malefactors with their irons on them, mounting thoſe who would joyn with them; and after they had proclaimed <hi>Charls

                     <p>But ſoon after, came news, ſignifying the totall defeat of thoſe under <hi>Wagſtaffe, Jones, Penruddock,</hi> and <hi>Groves;</hi> for <hi>Unton Crook,</hi> a Captain, purſuing them out of Wiltſhire into Devonſhire, with his own onely Troop, fell in amongſt them at <hi>South-Molton:</hi> where after a few hours diſpute, he took <hi>Jones, Penruddock,</hi> and <hi>Groves,</hi> (with about 60 other priſoners, and nigh 140 horſe and arms, <hi>Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaffe</hi> himſelf eſcaping) who being committed to <hi>Exeter</hi> Goal, a Commiſſion ſoon came forth for the tryall of the riſers, at <hi>Saliſbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Exeter,</hi> and <hi>Chard</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> and 14 of 30 being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned at <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> three of them, to wit, <hi>Lutas, Thorp,</hi> and <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> were on <hi>May</hi> 3. 1655, executed, with ſeven others on the 7th day; and on <hi>May</hi> the 9th, 14 of the condemned perſons at <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> were there alſo executed, (moſt being reprieved) amongſt whom, <hi>Penruddock</hi> and <hi>Groves</hi> were beheaded: but <hi>Jones</hi> (by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) likewiſe reprieved.

The Meſſenger departing likewiſe in haſte for <hi>Spain,</hi> Jan. 21. 1653, with Letters of the ſame nature, to that King; which interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, produced no effect: however, it hath been obſerved, theſe two Monarchies have been like the Sea, loſing at one place and time, what they gain in another; ſo vexing themſelves and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope alſo to no purpoſe.

                     <p>But on June 7th 1654, the young King of <hi>France</hi> was crowned at <hi>Rheimes</hi> with a great acclamation of the Inhabitants and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of that City, who met him half a mile out of the Town, crying, <hi>Vive le Roy,</hi> or, Let the King live. The Miniſters of <hi>Rheims</hi> alſo highly applauding the Cardinal in their Orations upon the anoynting of the King, looking on him as the onely means that hath kept up the Scepter from falling into the hands of an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Prince, that is, <hi>Conde,</hi> who ſeeks more his own greatneſſe, than the welfare of the Nation. The Cardinal of <hi>Retz,</hi> being kept confined by <hi>Mazarine,</hi> one pretence whereof was, the nor ſurrendring up of the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Paris;</hi> he ſent about this time, the Maſter of his horſe to <hi>Rome,</hi> to pray the Pope to give his conſent unto the ſame ſurrender, that <hi>Mazarine</hi> might have no farther pretence for keeping him ſo confined.</p>
                     <p>Now alſo was there preparation made in <hi>France</hi> for the ſiege of <hi>Stenay,</hi> by the King and Cardinal, the onely place that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had at his Command; and at which ſiege, the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to aſſiſt in Perſon: and the Cardinal reſolved to take that ſtrong place, though with length of time, and vaſt expences: wherefore ſetting about it, and the young King couragiouſly and induſtriouſly viſiting that Leaguer, and animating the Souldiety, after a great Bartery raiſed, he ſummoned the place: which the Governour refuſing to ſurrender, without <hi>Condee</hi>'s conſent, they applyed themſelves to carry the Cittadel firſt: whereupon the beſieged made a reſolute ſalſey of above 200 men; but they ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon the <hi>Switzers</hi> quarter, were by them valiantly repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: the Governour after a ſecond ſummons, ſending anſwer back, he was reſolved to live and die in the place; they drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether more Forces to reinforce the King's Camp: the beſieged having by a ſally killed between 3 and 400 of the beſiegers; yet ſhortly after (for that was in July 1654) in Auguſt, they having made a very great breach with their Mine, they came to a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation for ſurrender, which was made with a Spaniſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, the Earl of <hi>Chamilly</hi> accepting of the King's pardon in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring it, and the garriſon retreating to <hi>Montmedy.</hi>

                     <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to divert the French Forces that had beſieged <hi>Stenay,</hi> cloſely beſieged <hi>Arras,</hi> a conſiderable Frontier Town belonging to the French King: whoſe Governour was no leſſe couragious than that of <hi>Stenay;</hi> and the management of the ſiege being (by the <hi>Spaniard</hi>) ſaid to be ſolely committed unto the Prince of <hi>Condee;</hi> who had full power to fight as he ſhould ſee occaſion. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were in great want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion; the French having ſo ſecured the paſſages, that none could be brought unto them: yet a Convoy of 1000 Wagons being ſent from <hi>Doway</hi> to victual the Camp, and through ſome oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, retreating to <hi>Aire,</hi> from thence got ſafe within the lines of the Spaniſh Camp; whereby they were ſupplyed for 3 weeks: which was longer than (at that time) the Town was (in the eyes of many) likely to hold out: The Spaniards, Aug. 14, aſſaulting a
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:33388:273"/>half Moon of <hi>Arras,</hi> were beaten off with the loſſe of 400 men. But Marſhal <hi>Turein,</hi> with divers other forces from all parts, haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the relief of the beſieged, (ſo that they had no leſſe than 40000 in all) the Spaniard alſo lurking too long in his Trenches, and not engaging the French Army at the firſt, (as the Prince of <hi>Condee</hi> is reported to have adviſed them) they having hereby the more opportunity to circumvent them in all paſſages, and hinder the acceſſe of proviſions, they ſurrounded the Spaniſh Army, and actually hindred all proviſions for their relief: wherefore the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> being reduced to this ſtrait, were neceſſitated to withdraw from before the Town, on the firſt hopeful opportunity, and that in the night, leaving their Ordnance and baggage behind them; yet the French having notice by their Scouts, of their firſt motion, the grand Army under Marſhal <hi>D. Hoquincourt</hi> (notwithſtanding all the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> could do by perſwaſion or example) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on amain upon them, routed the Arch-Duke's horſe, leaving moſt of their foot to their enemie's mercy; with their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, bag and baggage. But the Governour of <hi>Arras</hi> himſelf (knowing the time of the Spaniards intended retreat) ſallying out with about 1500 or 2000 men at the inſtant of their moving, did much facilitate the buſineſſe; moſt of the Spaniſh foot being ſlain or taken, to the number of 6000 priſoners; and the firſt Onſett being made upon the <hi>Lorrainer</hi>'s trenches, the worſt ſtorm fell on them; and many almoſt ſtarved for lack of food: This happened in Auguſt, 1654. Which ſucceſſe rendred Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> impregnable; whereas, if he had been put to the like retreat, it was ſuppoſed he muſt have ſhortly retired out of <hi>France</hi> again: for thoſe of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> were then diſcontented by reaſon of ſome new impoſts lately impoſed on ſome Commodities there, by means of <hi>Trompette</hi> Caſtle ſerving to keep that Town in awe: the diſcontented alſo ſcattering ſeveral papers up and down, againſt tyranny, and the oppreſſion which they lay under; and it was then verily believed, if <hi>Arras</hi> had been taken by the Spaniard, more places would have ſhewn their diſcontent by reaſon of the heavy impoſts laid on them.</p>
                     <p>But the Country of <hi>Liege</hi> was about the moneths of January and Febr. 1653, in a ſad condition; both by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who quartered his Troops there, partly by conſent, and partly by force, pretending, the States of the Country did invite him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe their Prince and Biſhop governed altogether abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and againſt their Laws and priviledges; ſo that he was come to redreſſe their grievances, and beget a good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the Biſhop and his people. The Prince of <hi>Condee</hi>'s Troops (on the other hand) pretending, that thoſe of <hi>Liege</hi> were affected to, and held correſpondence with, the <hi>French:</hi> alſo that it was the <hi>Lorrainers</hi> which betrayed them, doing them all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſchief they can contrive where ever they come: wherefore they were come to ſecure them and their Country, from being preyed on by the <hi>Lorrainers.</hi> The Troops likewiſe of the King of

Wherefore, all theſe cauſed the Spaniſh Troops, and thoſe of the United Provinces to march alſo towards the ſame Country; both to hinder the French Troops from entring into <hi>Liege,</hi> and to ſecure their Frontiers. Thus although neither of theſe ought to have come there, the Country being Neutral; yet, through theſe quarrels and debates, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants were miſerably uſed like enemies on all ſides.</p>
                     <p>But theſe thus forcibly quartering in the Country, occaſioned the Prince or Biſhop of <hi>Liege,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Collen,</hi> to make a league offenſive and defenſive with the two Electours of <hi>Triers</hi> and <hi>Mentz,</hi> mutually to aſsiſt each other againſt all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of forreign forces under what pretence ſoever: and in March following, the Marqueſs of <hi>Faber</hi> ſeeing the concluſion of peace between the Prince of <hi>Liege,</hi> and the Electour of <hi>Collen,</hi> and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold</hi> the Arch-Duke, (whereby the firſt was obliged unto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, by the article of the Treaty, to endeavour what he could to cauſe the French Army to remove out of his Territories, being (if gentle perſwaſions would not prevail) to joyn his forces with the Arch Duke's, and force them, if they conceived it advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſo to do; preſently removing from <hi>Limbourg,</hi> marcht out of the Country of <hi>Liege</hi> the ſame way he came, towards the Woods of <hi>Ardenne;</hi> yet having firſt the Paroll of the Prince Electour, that neither the <hi>Spaniards, Lorrainers,</hi> or Prince of <hi>Condee</hi>'s forces, ſhould attempt any thing againſt them by vertue of the ſaid peace.

                     <p>But the Great Duke of <hi>Maſcovy</hi> decreeing hoſtility againſt the kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> about the latter end of 1653, reſolving alſo to invade the ſame with three Armies, in three ſundry places; and waging actual war accordingly, wrote Letters about April 1654, unto the Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> ſignifying the two reaſons of his ſaid War with the <hi>Polander:</hi> which ſeem not to be of weight ſufficient for ſuch an attempt: the one being, becauſe a certain <hi>Polander</hi> writing a Narration of former Wars betwixt them, wherein the <hi>Polanders</hi> had the better, ſaid onely, <hi>They had beaten the Muſcovite;</hi> without adding his Title.

                     <p>About November following, the Town of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of the beſt fortified places in Europe, was after an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent long ſiege, ſurrendred unto the grand Duke of <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> and that through the Enemies policy, who perſwading the <hi>Palatine,</hi> that all <hi>Poland</hi> was loſt, and that that place onely made reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; the <hi>Palatine</hi> being ſtricken with a panick fear, and ſeeing no leſſe than an Army of 5 or 6 bodies encompaſſing him, was eaſily perſwaded, yet on as honourable terms as he could deſire; but, immediately hereupon, no leſſe than 5000 of his men liſted themſelves under the <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> and taking an oath to be true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Wherefore, ſeeing the place was both provided with neceſſaries for a years ſiege, nor any powder wanting unto the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, the King of <hi>Poland</hi> required the ſaid <hi>Palatine</hi> to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to <hi>Grodna,</hi> to give him an account of his proceedings. The Muſcoviter put a garriſon of 10000 men into the City.

Unto which the <hi>Swediſh</hi> King ſignified his inclination; and was daily in Counſel with his Senators, about the <hi>Poland</hi> affairs, as being much inclined to an Alliance offenſive and defenſive with that Crown, by reaſon of the progreſs which the extraordinary numerous for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> made in <hi>Lithuania;</hi> and who not onely kept his frontiers well guarded with forces; but ſent others into the Arch-biſhoprick of <hi>Bremen,</hi> both to make good his pretenſions there, and to threaten war upon the Duke of <hi>Newburg.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At or about the ſame time, while the King of <hi>Poland</hi> lay at <hi>Grodna,</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> ſent him an Envoy, to demand a reſtoring of certain Towns, which he held in <hi>Hungary,</hi> which were pawned unto <hi>Poland</hi> about 200 years before; offering to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſe the money for their redemption. But the King put him off for an anſwer, to the next Diet or Aſſembly of the Kingdom, ſhewing not much diſpoſure to yield thereunto.</p>
                     <p>But about the moneth of Auguſt, 1654, the Kingdom of <hi>Sweden</hi> diſpatched Forces to beſiege the City of <hi>Bremen,</hi> for ſome inſolence committed againſt that Crown whom it was thought, (by the <hi>Swedes</hi>) that the Emperour and German Princes did privately ſtir up againſt him; who elſe could not have been believed, to be ſo bold, as (of themſelves) to provoke againſt them ſo conſiderable an enemy. <hi>Koningſmark</hi> had the managing of that ſiege; who about the beginning of September, making ſhew as if he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go over to <hi>Vegeſak,</hi> drew a great party of the <hi>Bremers</hi> thither; and after Sun-ſet, taking a quite contrary march, he cauſed a bridg to be made over the water called the <hi>Ham,</hi> and paſſed over it in the night; and ſo over the Moors, (though with great difficulty, by reaſon of the extream deep and muddy ground) wherein, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſeveral horſes were ſmothered, yet not one man loſt; and this (notwithſtanding they played with their Canon out of the City) to the <hi>Bremers</hi> great admiration.

In all which the <hi>Swedes</hi> are ſaid to have loſt but two men.

                     <p>Three or four moneths before which time, <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> (for reaſons either voluntary, or conſtrained) reſigned her Crown unto <hi>Charls Guſtave,</hi> her Couſen.

Where being entertained in an extraordinary manner by that Arch-Duke, too large here particularly to relate, and which was in or about the moneth October, 1655, the next day but one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her arrivall there, ſhe made an open profeſſion of the Romiſh Catholique faith, in ſix heads or Sections; where <hi>Holſtenius,</hi> Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 7th his Nuntio (in preſence of the Arch-Duke, his Lady and brother, and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, &amp;c.) ſtanding at the right ſide of the Altar, (and ſhe on the left) ſaid, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> underſtanding that <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> being enlightned by the Holy Ghoſt, intended to put her ſelf into the boſome of the Church, had ſent his Letters, teſtifying his Approbation of her deſires; and to receive her with his Apoſtolical Benediction, he being there to know the truth thereof. Unto which ſhe anſwering, It was ſo; <hi>Holſtenius</hi> giving the Pope's Letter to a Prieſt who read it aloud, deſired ſhe would make profeſſion of the ſaid faith, and ſwear upon the holy Evangeliſt, to keep it, before the Arch-Duke, and the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour. Which ſhe doing, and kiſſing the book, a Chair was ſet for <hi>Holſtenius,</hi> and a Cuſhion laid at his feet, upon which the Queen kneeling, he making the ſign of the Croſſe over her head, and embracing her ſhoulders, ſaid, He did receive her into the Catholike Church, and by virtue of an order from the Holy Father Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 7th, and from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er given him by Chriſt, whoſe Vicar he was, he did abſolve her from all her ſins ſhe had committed, <hi>In the Name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> This being done, their <hi>Te Deum,</hi> &amp;c. was ſung with moſt melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious voices, and all ſorts of Inſtruments, and Drums, in the very Chappel of the Franciſcans or Arch-Duke where it was done; then 50 pieces of Ordnance being diſcharged, ſhe returned as ſhe
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:33388:276"/>came. <hi>Charls Guſtave</hi> not long after his Coronation, was married with great Pomp and Solemnity unto the daughter of the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> at <hi>Stockholm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But about the moneth of June, 1654, there was ſent over from <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Holland,</hi> a Copy of the ſecret Articles agreed on by the States of <hi>Holland</hi> alone in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Treaty, to the prejudice of the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> the effect whereof was, That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of <hi>England</hi> having often repreſented, That in caſe the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> or Poſterity of the houſe of <hi>Stuart,</hi> ſhould command the Militia of that State, they might occaſion great differences, or at leaſt great jealouſies between the two Nations. The States of <hi>Holland,</hi> to remove that apprehenſion, firſt debating the matter, concluded, That for the future, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and all of his line, ſhould be excluded from the Government and Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Province of <hi>Holland:</hi> and if the other Provinces would chooſe him for Captain and Admiral-General, they would never conſent to the ſame. Which cauſing a great diſturbance in the Aſſembly of the States General, they ordered Copies thereof to be ſent to the other Provinces, before they reſolved on any thing. The Commiſſioners of <hi>Holland</hi> in the mean time excuſing the buſineſs unto the Princeſs Dowager, telling her, They were conſtrained to do what they did: hoping notwithſtanding, that before the Prince were of age, the affairs of that State might be ſubject to ſome alteration, which might re-eſtabliſh him into what they had then taken from him. But this action of theirs produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced divers paper-combats from the other Provinces, who were againſt his ſecluſion.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time, the <hi>Venetian</hi> obtained a great Victory over the Turk, having fought them two dayes together in the <hi>Archipelago</hi> or <hi>Dardanelles;</hi> wherein they ſlew 6000 Turks, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the General, <hi>Amurath Baſsa,</hi> to death; taking alſo four Men of War, and 16 Galleys; yet not without the loſſe (on their own part) of many brave ones, one Galliot, and 5 Gallies. The Turks alſo the ſame year, in or about December, making an attempt by night upon the Fortreſſe of <hi>Veſprin</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> as thinking to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize it; found ſuch reſiſtance, that they were forced to retire, with the loſſe of 900 kill'd and taken.</p>
                     <p>Not long before which, the Grand Seignior of the Turks being advertiſed, that the Vizier Baſſa had long projected to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Emperour, through the aſſiſtance of the Greeks who were to have rebelled alſo, by the ſtraight correſpondence he held (for that purpoſe) with the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> and <hi>Coſsacks,</hi> whom he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to embrace the Greek Religion; he conventing him before a private Councel, and upbraiding him of his Treaſon, after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny benefits done him; he was condemned to death, and ſtrangled within five or ſix hours; impriſoning alſo the Patriarch of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</p>
                     <p>Toward the latter end of this year alſo, through the Leavies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing and increaſing in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſome rupture was feared in
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:33388:277"/>that Empire; for the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> having a quarrel with the great Dean of his Dioceſs, was back'd by the Canons, yet reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding without the City; but the Dean had the affection of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and was within the City: wherefore the Biſhop armed againſt the City, and they againſt him; who deſigning to take it by a ſurprizall, with 200 horſe, and 400 foot, at the opening of the gates; the Ambuſcado was diſcovered, and the deſign fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
                     <p>The Prince Electour <hi>Palatine,</hi> had then alſo two quarrels with two <hi>German</hi> Prelates: one with the Electour Archbiſhop of <hi>Ments,</hi> which was for the juriſdiction of a Place, into which, the laſt would ſettle ſome Prieſts, as belonging to him; but the Prince would have ſettled there Miniſters of the reformed Religion; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, He ought to diſpoſe thereof, as having been ſo many years in poſſeſſion; but the people the while remained unprovided of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The other was againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Spiers;</hi> becauſe thoſe of that City (<hi>Worms</hi> alſo ſeconding them) had both yielded (in all probability) upon the account of Religion, themſelves into the <hi>Palatine</hi>'s Protection. But the Emperour, who himſelf was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then very buſie in making great levies; forbade them to proceed any further in their contention: but admoniſhing them to plead their cauſes in Courts of Juſtice. The ſaid Emperour, Jan. 2. 1654, commanding all the chiefeſt of the Proteſtant Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and round about it, to meet together at an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place; but, they not meeting, a new command came, for them to meet at the place appointed; who then coming in great numbers, and moſt of them 50 and 80 years old: they firſt were checked for not coming at the firſt ſummons; and then had paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports given them to depart out of his hereditary dominions, and to retire to ſome other place than <hi>Hungary:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame year the Duke of <hi>Pomerania</hi> (who was the laſt of that houſe) dying, and his body being with great ſolemnity interred; his whole Eſtate was divided betwixt <hi>Sweden</hi> and the Electour of <hi>Brandenburgh:</hi> the Commiſſioners of the former, and the Elector, equally parting his broken Seal, and equally defraying the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his Funeral.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, it may not be frivolous, to relate one treachery (among others) which was diſcovered in <hi>Flanders</hi> about <hi>January,</hi> 1653; it was to betray and deliver <hi>Armentiers,</hi> one of the chief Frontier Garriſons of that Country into the <hi>French</hi> their hands, for a ſumm of money: which deſign was on this manner laid; ſome of a Regiment of Iriſh there in garriſon (knowing there were ſome of their own Nation in the <hi>French</hi> garriſons of <hi>Baſsee</hi> and <hi>Bethune,</hi> not far from <hi>Armentiers,</hi> which is ſcituated on the River <hi>Liſle,</hi>) running away diſcontented, joyned to the aforeſaid garriſons of <hi>French;</hi> ſome Iriſh alſo of the other ſide, came over to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in <hi>Armentiers,</hi> and there liſted themſelves, ſpeaking very ill of the <hi>French</hi> Officers.

Theſe Forces, being joyned with the <hi>French,</hi> (after they had taken <hi>Montmedy</hi> and St. <hi>Venant</hi>) took the ſtrong Fort of <hi>Mardike</hi> (not far from <hi>Dunkirk</hi>) from the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> which being afterwards maintained by Engliſh; in the moneth October of the ſame year 1657, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> forces attempting to ſtorm it; among whom, 2000 of the Scottiſh and Iriſh Reformadoes under the Scottiſh King, (who, with his brother the Duke of <hi>York</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excluded <hi>France,</hi> joyned with the <hi>Spaniard</hi>) made the firſt onſett, and that in three ſeveral places at once, getting into the ditches, and ready for ſcaling: the Engliſh behaved themſelves ſo couragiouſly all the time, (which continued 6 hours) that they were repulſed with the loſſe of about 600 men. And more ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes going out of <hi>England,</hi> there was a field-battle fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the French and Engliſh with the Spaniſh forces (being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 6 and 7000 foot, and 9000 horſe) who came to relieve <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> beſieged by the Engliſh and French: in which (after ſome diſputes) both their wings being foyled, they fled: the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh foot purſuing them about two miles and an half; and the French horſe down from the hill as far as <hi>Fern,</hi> from whoſe Fort they were drawn. It was a great Victory; for moſt of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> foot were either ſlain or taken; all their guns, 6 in number, with the baggage of the field; as alſo all the Officers of <hi>Charls Stuart</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, (with many more Officers of quality) with his own Coach; and about 17 colours: (the Marſhal of <hi>Hocquincourt</hi> (who had been the chief inſtrument in the revolt of <hi>Heſdin</hi>) being ſlain as he was pickqueering a day or two before the battle) the loſs of the Engliſh being 80 ſlain, and about 300 wounded: this was in June 1658.

Wherefore they having time given them till the 29th day of the ſame moneth, to ſend to <hi>Don John</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> General, (if he did not relieve them in that time) they Capitulated with the Cardinal, to depart the Town on the 30th day of the ſame, much according to the conditions of <hi>Dunkirk;</hi> which they did accordingly, as not being relieved; although <hi>Don John,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Caracene,</hi> joyned with reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to have attempted it: who were prevented by Marſhal <hi>Turein</hi> his advance to lye betwixt <hi>Fern</hi> and <hi>Bergen.</hi> Then was a Councel of War called, wherein the Cardinal, <hi>Turein,</hi> and <hi>La Ferte</hi> (whoſe Armies, after the taking of <hi>Graveline,</hi> were united) were preſent: and where they reſolved what Town next to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege; which was believed to be <hi>Ypre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But upon another dangerous Plot reported to be diſcovered, Apr. 9. 1657, four perſons of Note, to wit, M. General <hi>Harriſon,</hi> Colonel <hi>Rich,</hi> Major <hi>Danvers,</hi> and Captain <hi>Lawſon,</hi> were ſecured the day following.</p>
                     <p>A little after, to wit, July 24, 1657, Colonel <hi>Edward Sexby,</hi> (who was a principal man in promoting <hi>Miles Sindercomb</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, as aboveſaid; and who came into <hi>England</hi> in a diſguiſed habit the better to effect it) was committed to the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> for high Treaſon; But within 10 dayes after his commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he falling ſick of an Ague and Vomiting, which turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a violent Feaver, he dyed Jan. 13th after in the Tower; found by the Coronet's Jury to be by Gods viſitation, and by no other wayes or means.</p>
                     <p>But the year following, which is this preſent year 1658, about the moneth of <hi>May,</hi> was diſcovered another great and general Plot to embroyl <hi>England</hi> in new Wars and Seditions, by levying war, betraying of the ſtrong garriſon of <hi>Hull;</hi> promoting <hi>Charls Stuart</hi> to be King of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſecuring the City of <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c. For which, many were committed to the Tower and Newgate; and a High Court of Juſtice being erected (who ſate <hi>May</hi> 25) in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall, Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> on the ſame day, and Doctor <hi>Hewet,</hi> a Divine, on June 1. following, were brought to their tryall before them: the Knight pleading, <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> was proved guilty by evidence. The Doctor refuſing to plead to his charge, and chooſing rather to die, than own the Authority; wherefore June 2d, they were adjudged to be hanged and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at Tyburn as Traytors; but being (by the clemency of the Protectour) to be beheaded, execution was done on them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly on the 8th day of the ſame June 1658. After which, one <hi>Sumner,</hi> and 6 others of the City of <hi>London,</hi> were tryed upon
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:33388:280"/>the ſame account: one being found as not guilty; but ſix con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be executed for Traytors: two of whom, to wit, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Aſhton</hi> and <hi>Betteley</hi> in ſeveral places of <hi>London,</hi> were executed on July the 7th after; one whoſe name was <hi>Frier,</hi> (and who pleading <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> did upon the matter preſently confeſſe it) being reprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: and July 9th, one <hi>Stacie</hi> was alſo hanged, though not quartered: <hi>Sumner</hi> and <hi>Allen</hi> (who confeſſed themſelves guilty) being both reprieved.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, three or four more than ordinary things happened in <hi>England</hi> within two or three years laſt paſt. One was, Octob. 3. 1656, when as the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> which uſually ebbeth about 7 or 8 hours, and floweth about 4 or 5, now ebbed and flowed twice in 3 hours ſpace. A lamentable accident by Gunpowder in a Ship-Chandler's ſtore-houſe near the Hermitage in <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> July 3. 1657. Alſo at <hi>Bickley</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> the ground ſunk, July 8th, 1657, And on the firſt or ſecond of June, 1658, a Whale of about 58 or 59 foot in length, and of a bulk proportionable, coming up the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> was taken and flain, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Greenwich</hi> 4 miles from <hi>London:</hi> ſome of the multitude that went to ſee this young Monſter or King of Fiſhes, preſaging (as it were) the death of a great Perſon to enſue; for that in King <hi>James</hi> his time a little before the death of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> there was one, not ſo big, but ſeen about <hi>Blackwall,</hi> on the ſaid River.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>France,</hi> in Jan. 1654, there was an Aſſembly called of Prelates &amp; other Church-men at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> in Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; himſelf being preſent, and alſo the King's Deputy, with the Archbiſhop of <hi>Roven</hi> as the Preſident, upon occaſion of a Brief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by that King from the Pope, relating to a Bull of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſet forth againſt the doctrine of <hi>Janſenus,</hi> who was Biſhop of <hi>Ypre</hi> in <hi>Flanders:</hi> which doctrine very nearly agreed with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, touching Works, Free-Will, &amp;c. which the Author ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially proving out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> it got no ſmall ground both in <hi>France</hi> and the Netherlands; ſo that it was conceived, the diviſion thereupon made among the Papiſts, had given a great wound unto the Papal intereſt: Wherefore the Pope not being able to contain any longer, let looſe his Bull in <hi>France.</hi> The Archbiſhop declared the neceſſity of ſetting forth a Confeſſion of Faith according to the Roman Catholick Religion; yet notwithſtanding, nothing was concluded. The Cardinal alſo and the Archbiſhop fell out there, about the Cardinal's impriſonment of Cardinal <hi>de Retz;</hi> he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring how <hi>Mazarine</hi> durſt proceed ſo far againſt him, who was both a Prieſt, and Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> the head City of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp;c. after words paſſing between them, they parted in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content at each other. The King of <hi>France</hi> about the ſame time ſetting forth a general Declaration, That no other Religion be there entertained, beſides the Roman, and that called the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: of which there had been a toleration in times paſt.</p>
                     <p>But in 1655, about the moneth of April, the Proteſtants in the Valleys of <hi>Angrogna, Lucerna,</hi> and St. <hi>Martin,</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
                        <pb n="548" facs="tcp:33388:281"/>were ſorely vexed and perſecuted by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> whoſe Subjects they were, through the inſtigation of Prieſts and Jeſuits, having ſet up a new Inquiſition at <hi>Turin;</hi> who firſt affrightning them with great threatenings, then proceeding to take away their goods and eſtates, impriſoning them, and uſing all violence to make them forſake their Religion; and perceiving they could avail nothing thereby; the Duke was perſwaded to ſend an Army of about 8000 under the Marqueſs <hi>de Pianella,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Quince,</hi> one of the French Lievtenant Generals; theſe ſetting upon this poor people living quietly at home: They ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thus aſſaulted, ſtood in their defence, making what reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance they could againſt them: many of whom were ſlain, (and ſome of the enemy) many carried away priſoners, on whom they uſed all manner of invented cruelties, and in many corners, they ſhamefully abuſing and tormenting many women, with their young children, afterwards cut off their heads; daſhing alſo thoſe children of 15 years old (that would not go to Maſs) againſt the rocks; hanging others with their feet upwards, and nailing them to Trees: which they were ſaid to endure with a moſt invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible reſolution. A reſidue which eſcaped the ſlaughter, got into the Mountains with their Wives and Children, enduring there much hunger and cold; (ſome dying therewith) the enemy (the while) ſet fire on their Temples, plundered their houſes, and then fired them: a very ſmall number, with their families, got into <hi>Dauſine</hi> in the French Dominions, and ſome others into <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Theſe are of thoſe, who about 500 years ago being then called <hi>Vaudois</hi> and <hi>Albigois,</hi> were cruelly perſecuted by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. Their ſad condition being repreſented abroad, the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Protectour</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. ſeemed to be much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therewith: there was alſo ſending to the King of <hi>France</hi> about the buſineſſe, (Collections for their relief being likewiſe made among the Proteſtants abroad) who having then a Treaty of Peace in hand with <hi>England,</hi> not a little concerning his intereſt, became a Mediatour by his Ambaſſadour Monſieur <hi>de Servient,</hi> (alſo four Ambaſſadours of <hi>Switzerland</hi> as Mediatours) in their behalf to the Duke: who in or about Auguſt following, came to Articles of Agreement, for reſtoring the ſaid Proteſtants to live in his Dominions as formerly; with the ſame free exerciſe of their Religion: yet were in many things cut ſhort, and ſtraitned more than before; as to have no dwelling beyond the River <hi>Pelice,</hi> and ſome other places, except to the Vineyards of <hi>Lucerna</hi> towards <hi>Rorata:</hi> and alſo to live at St. <hi>Johns,</hi> but not to have any publique aſſembling place or preaching as before, &amp;c. But one who wrote (from <hi>Pigneroll</hi>) obſervations upon thoſe Articles, calls the peace made with his brethren of the Valleys and the Duke, to be far worſe than the worſt of War; and that it was forced on them by the threatnings of the French Ambaſſadour, and the falſhood of others entruſted on their behalf in the Treaty; ſaying alſo, That had they ſtayed ſo long, as to admit of any interpoſer in the name
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:33388:281"/>of the <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> the matter would never have been ſo ended. A little after, or about which time of agreement, the French be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Pavia;</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Caracene</hi> came near the City with his Auxiliary Spaniſh Forces to relieve it; and the beſieged making a very ſtout ſally, and then joyning with the Marqueſs, they fell upon the beſiegers within the lines of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvallation, and put them to the rout and flight: the ſlain of whom, were moſt of the <hi>Savoy</hi> forces: among whom, were thoſe bloody ones who acted the cruelties on the Proteſtants of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi> They were alſo ſo ſoundly beaten at that time, that they were conſtrained to a ſhameful retreat; not having of 24000, above 8000 left in a body of all the united forces of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Savoyards,</hi> who were under Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> his Conduct of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and of the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> who commanded his own. It was alſo certified about the ſame time, that the Governour of <hi>San Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo</hi> in <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> ſending his Son into <hi>Spain</hi> to the King, to make a relation of his Father's Services and Succeſſes in oppoſing the Engliſh there; the King made the Father a Marqueſs, giving him a Penſion of 5000 Duckats a year; and rewarded the Son with 1500 Duckats a year.</p>
                     <p>But in <hi>Sweden,</hi> after that <hi>Charls Guſtave</hi> was crowned and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in that Kingdom, and peace concluded with the Citizens of <hi>Bremen,</hi> great preparations for War were making in divers places of that Kingdom, and alſo in the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> againſt the grand Duke of <hi>Moſcovie:</hi> yet, in the mean time, the King (for as much as the Great Duke, notwithſtanding their refuſal in <hi>Sweden</hi> to give him his pretended Titles, had not as yet declared any deſign upon that Crown) being unwilling to engage ſo far, if it might be avoided, in a matter of ſo great importance, ſent to the ſaid Duke, to addreſſe unto him, and feel what his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes were toward his Frontiers of <hi>Ingermerland</hi> and <hi>Liefland,</hi> and how he determined concerning them: who about the ſame time taking the conſiderable Fort of <hi>Dunenbergh,</hi> 25 miles from <hi>Riga,</hi> from the <hi>Poles,</hi> was grown ſo high, as to demand from the <hi>Swede,</hi> or Duke of <hi>Curland,</hi> a paſſe for 50000 men thorow <hi>Liefland,</hi> or the others Dominions: whereby the <hi>Poles</hi> were not a little ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, it being the onely hopes they had, that, that proud enemy by ſuch inſolent demeanour, would provoke the Crown of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> or ſome other conſiderable State, to come upon him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might be diverted from bringing them to utter ruine and deſtruction; for the State of <hi>Poland</hi> was, by means of that tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical enemy, then looked on as in a very ſad and ill condition: (whoſe Army although it were made up to a good number in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuania,</hi> (wholly laid waſte) yet were their diviſions among its Commanders, which might hinder them from doing then any great matter;) for the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> taking (among other miſeries and miſchiefs) the Town of <hi>Vitebsko,</hi> after a furious aſſault, (having loſt many Commanders and Souldiers during the ſiege, and in the ſtorming) in a rage, when he entred the Town, put all to the
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:33388:282"/>ſword, not ſparing the women and children. Theſe tranſactions were toward the latter end of 1654; at which time, 40000 <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> arrived from the grand Cham for <hi>Poland</hi>'s aſſiſtance; he ſending alſo a new aſſurance with them, punctually to perform whatever he had promiſed: and that becauſe the Rivers were not frozen for paſſage, therefore the Troops came no ſooner: with which <hi>Tartarian</hi> ſuccours, the <hi>Poland</hi> forces (marching toward the City of <hi>Breſlavia,</hi> to joyn) had a ſtiff encounter with 13000 Coſſacks, which lay there for defence of that place; but they being forced to retreat in great diſorder, the Capital City of that Province returned to the obedience of their Soveraign: and ſoon after, the Poliſh Army in <hi>Ukrain,</hi> proſecuting their advantages with reſolution, gave a defeat to another body of 6000 <hi>Coſsacks;</hi> which ſo took down <hi>Chmielniskie</hi>'s ſtomach, that he being now inclined to terms of ſubmiſſion, ſought by all means to induce the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to a renewing of the Treaty for peace. About which time, 4 <hi>Tartarian</hi> Lords arrived at <hi>Warſovia,</hi> bringing with them a ratification of the Alliance made with the new Cham: who were to ſtay in that City in hoſtage for the obſervation of the Treaty: whereby the King of <hi>Poland</hi> was likewiſe obliged to ſend 4 Lords to reſide with the <hi>Tartar</hi> in the City of <hi>Crim,</hi> who alſo out of affection to <hi>Poland</hi> at that time, ſet at liberty all impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned <hi>Polanders</hi> within his Dominions: And ſoon after theſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours ſent by the Tartar, the Poliſh Generals in the <hi>Ukrain,</hi> paſſed over the River <hi>Bog</hi> with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> with deſign to beſiege the City <hi>Uman;</hi> that <hi>Chmielniski</hi> might thereby be forced to take the field, and endeavour to relieve the ſame: wherefore they ſitting down before <hi>Uman,</hi> Febr. 19. 1654, they roſe again on the 21 day, being informed, that <hi>Chmielniski</hi> was coming with 40000 Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks, and 20000 <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> to raiſe the ſiege: and preparing to meet them, the next day being the 22, towards the Evening the battle began; wherein <hi>Chmielniskie</hi>'s forces were routed, and retreating with ſpeed unto their ſtrong holds; ſo that, the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> having purſued them all night, they retired to take care of their wounded, and refreſh themſelves, being very much diſcommodated by the froſty weather's extremity.</p>
                     <p>Prince <hi>Radzivil</hi> had likewiſe (about that time) no leſſe ſucceſſe with his forces in <hi>Lithuania:</hi> where he took the Town of <hi>Biskow</hi> by Aſſault, although defended by about 20000 <hi>Coſsacks;</hi> moſt of which were ſlain and taken priſoners. About the ſame time alſo, the peſtilence raging in the Royall City of <hi>Moſco,</hi> hindered the grand Duke's retreat; ſo that he encamped near <hi>Smolensko</hi> with 20000 men.</p>
                     <p>But the expectation of a perpetual Peace, and a League offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and defenſive between <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> (whoſe King by his Envoy declared his readineſſe to renounce all Titles and Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, claimed by his Predeceſſors, to the Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (after more than one Ambaſſadour ſent from <hi>Poland</hi> to <hi>Sweden</hi> to that purpoſe) fruſtrated: the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> (who a few
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:33388:282"/>moneths before had ordered 12 Regiments towards the borders of <hi>Livonia,</hi> to defend them from an Invaſion of the <hi>Muſcovites:</hi> againſt whom alſo a War was (at <hi>Stockholm</hi>) reſolved to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, in caſe the League forementioned, had (between the two Kingdoms) been concluded: unto which alſo (upon the Poliſh Envoy's Propoſals) the Swediſh King ſhewed himſelf to be ſo much inclined, that, (the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> giving him freſh occaſions of jealouſie and diſcontent) he drew together 24000 men, who were to march into <hi>Livonia</hi> (as ſoon as the frozen paſſages were more open) to attaque them by Land, whileſt the Ships of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhould go round about on purpoſe to obſtruct the <hi>Moſcovy</hi> Merchants, and diſturb their Commerce. The grand Duke alſo, by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> (reſolving on War with thoſe two Kings, who were then upon entring on a League offenſive and defenſive againſt him) buying up no leſſe than 40000 Muskets) makes great preparations both by Sea and Land, having now his deſign bent both againſt <hi>Poland</hi> on the one hand, and the Dukedome of <hi>Juliers</hi> and <hi>Bergh</hi> on the other; unto which Countries he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences: and drawing 8 Regiments of horſe and foot toward <hi>Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rania,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> armed for defence; as well as the <hi>Dantzickers</hi> put in great fear, that the <hi>Swede</hi> deſigned upon <hi>Pruſsia</hi> or ſome part near to it under the <hi>Poles.</hi> But the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> coming to a Treaty with the Electour of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> they (at length) joyned in an offenſive and defenſive league about the moneth of June, 1656; and meeting at the Town called <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in <hi>Pruſsia</hi> where they paſſed three dayes in moſt amicable conference; the <hi>Brandenburgian</hi> being to furniſh the <hi>Swede</hi> with 8000 armed men, with whom they were to joyn.</p>
                     <p>But about the moneth of <hi>May</hi> 1655, moſt that was to do in <hi>Poland,</hi> was to make preparations againſt the <hi>Swede,</hi> whom they believed, if he came into <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> &amp;c. would ſpoyl them, and do what he pleaſed: the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> making (to increaſe <hi>Poland</hi>'s mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery) alſo great preparation. A conſultation was alſo held by the <hi>Polanders</hi> in this moneth of <hi>May,</hi> when they ſhould be in action, for defence of the Kingdom, and ſupplying the Frontiers with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries: but in the mean time all Trading was there laid aſide.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſending an Army of 16 or 17000 horſe and foot into the <hi>Polander's</hi> Country near <hi>Kron,</hi> which lyes next to <hi>Germany,</hi> about the latter end of June, or the beginning of July, 1655, (as it appears) under the command of General <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> they ſoon took divers Caſtles and Garriſons in that Country, and making progreſs as far as <hi>Wſee,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Poſen;</hi> both the two <hi>Palatinates</hi> of <hi>Poſen</hi> and <hi>Caliſsen,</hi> together with the 4 Cities of <hi>Poſen, Caliſsen, Leſna,</hi> and <hi>Miedzierez,</hi> with an Army of 15000 men, renounced allegiance to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> came under the Protection of the King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> and all this before July 15th, 1655, and without one blow ſtruck: the Articles between <hi>Rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zieicouski</hi> Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Poland,</hi> and General <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> for
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:33388:283"/>ſurrender and agreement of and about the aforeſaid two Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates and Cities, being ſigned in the Camp at <hi>Wſee,</hi> in the ſame moneth of July, 1655. And for which, Inſtructions were ſent to the Biſhops and Superintendents in <hi>Sweden,</hi> to give thanks for the ſame, and obſerve a day of ſupplication for future ſucceſſes. About which time, there was a Declaration ſet forth in <hi>Sweden,</hi> forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> publickly to exerciſe their Religion: which notwithſtanding they then forbare to execute, out of reſpect (as was then reported) to the Engliſh; for the <hi>Swedes</hi> had then an Ambaſſadour in <hi>England,</hi> to get men to carry on their War in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or elſewhere; together with the procuring of a more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate alliance with the <hi>Protectour.</hi> Soon after this, two <hi>Waywoods</hi> more ſubmitted themſelves to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> taking <hi>Liſsa</hi> and <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſtadt.</hi> From <hi>Stetin,</hi> the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> (who was expected to follow General <hi>Wittenberg</hi> with his Army) marched with 10000 men, and a notable Artillery, for <hi>Poſen,</hi> and ſo for <hi>Warſovia</hi> and <hi>Thorne;</hi> entring Aug. 4. into that part of the Poliſh Kingdome, properly called <hi>Poland.</hi> Then alſo Young <hi>Tromp</hi> being ſent into the <hi>Sound</hi> by the States of the United Provinces, Admiral <hi>Wrangle</hi> had orders from the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to ſail thither with 9 ſtout Men of War, to require a poſitive anſwer of him, whether he intended Peace or War, (for theſe States began to engage, for tradings ſake, in the buſineſſe) and what the Swedes might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him. About the fame time the King of <hi>Poland</hi> ſet up his Standard at <hi>Warſovia,</hi> whither having ſummoned in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he made but 16000 men at the moſt, and ſuch, as never ſaw the face of an enemy.</p>

                     <p>But the general Rendezvouz of the King of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Army being at <hi>Lowicks,</hi> ſome 36 miles from <hi>Warſow,</hi> the ſaid King after a ſword received from the Pope's Nuntio, hallowed, departed from <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſow</hi> to the ſaid Army in the moneth of Auguſt, to try what virtue it would have againſt the Swediſh King: where then was arrived
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:33388:283"/>10000 horſe of the old Army which was at <hi>Ukrain,</hi> the Nobility and Gentry then coming alſo in great number from all parts: about which time, the Palatine of <hi>Siradia</hi> came under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of <hi>Sweden.</hi> And the Duke of <hi>Radzvill</hi> ſeeing that his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were thrunk into a ſmall number, made his agreement with the King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> as alſo the Biſhop of <hi>Vilna,</hi> and many other perſons of note.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> going in Auguſt 1655, from <hi>Turpitz</hi> with a ſtrong party of horſe, and 4 pieces of Ordnance, came to <hi>Klezki</hi> near <hi>Gueſna,</hi> on the 20th, being expected on the 21 day by General <hi>Wittenberg;</hi> that he might joyntly march with both Armies to <hi>Lowicks,</hi> and fight the Poliſh Army; which fell out accordingly in Septemb. following: In which battle the Victory falling to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> the King of <hi>Poland</hi> fled to <hi>Cracovia:</hi> wherefore, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> marching thither, drew near the City Sept. 15, where the Poliſh king ſtood with three Brigades; but the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unexpectedly approaching, the Poles quitting their Camp, betook themſelves to flight in great terrour and confuſion, ſetting part of the Suburbs on fire: whereupon the king of <hi>Sweden</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the City, took his Head quarter within a quarter of a mile thereof at a Convent belonging to the Dominicans, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs burning all night: and next day, Septemb. 16, the Swediſh king ſending a party, they poſſeſſed themſelves of the Bridg over the River <hi>Weyſsell;</hi> ſo entring the Suburbs, and that with little oppoſition, but no loſſe, although the enemy playing on them from the Caſtle, ſet ſome adjacent houſes on fire thereby; and within two dayes after, he giving order to frame a ſiege before both Caſtle and City, aſſigned his Forces to their ſeveral Poſts, plyed the Caſtle with Granadoes: which the enemy anſwering with Granadoes back again from the Caſtle, they ſet the Cloyſter of <hi>Agnes</hi> on fire, which taking hold of many other houſes, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to Cinders: and being in great hope of a ſurrender of that chief City, they made batteries, which the <hi>Poles</hi> both by ſhot and ſallies, endeavoured to hinder. The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> then alſo proclaimed unto all Provinces and Palatinates of that kingdome, That the Eſtates of the Realm might not onely freely meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Warſow,</hi> either in perſon, or by their Deputies; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them alſo ſpeedily to aſſemble, promiſing them his Royal favour, and a free exerciſe of their Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caſimir</hi> the king of <hi>Poland</hi> being fled, a Poliſh ſervant who was brought in priſoner, informed the <hi>Swedes,</hi> that <hi>Caſimir</hi> was retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Tarnaw</hi> to <hi>Tſionſick,</hi> to the very borders of <hi>Hungary,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no more than a few <hi>German</hi> horſe with him: Wherefore the Swediſh king thought to have purſued him; but his Counſels al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering on the 25 day, he returned the ſame night unto before <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covia:</hi> but ſending General <hi>Douglas</hi> (upon the priſoner's informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to ſee what was become of king <hi>Caſimir,</hi> he returning the ſame night, brought news, that the ſaid King was alſo fled from <hi>Tſionſick</hi> with a few towards <hi>Hungarie's</hi> borders: onely, that in
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:33388:284"/>and about the ſame Town of <hi>Tſionſick,</hi> lay about 8000 Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who expecting the event of the buſineſſe, were ſuppoſed no longer to ſtand out, than a ſtrong Party ſhould be ſent againſt them. In the mean time, the Lord <hi>Leskynski,</hi> the Poliſh Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, was buſie in acquainting his friends in <hi>Cracovia</hi> with the notable Succeſſes the Swediſh King had about that City, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in divers Caſtles and ſmaller fortified Towns round about, and reducing divers Parties to ſubmiſſion, perſwading them to be wiſe, in ſurrendring the City, and ſave themſelves: but <hi>Czarnecky</hi> the Governour being obſtinate, refuſing to ſurrender, and continuing ſhooting and ſallying, the King making ſpeedy preparation for a ſtorm, ſent in word to the ſaid <hi>Czarnecky</hi> the Governour, That if he would not yield unto an accommodation, but proceed in his obſtinacy; as ſoon as he ſhould get him into his power, (which he doubted not ſhortly to effect) he would give order to hang him up. Wherefore the beſieged ſuing to the King for their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to have letters of Conduct to come and treat, in the moneth Octob. following <hi>Cracovia</hi> was ſurrendred; there marching out the Garriſon, being 3000 men, (with 600 Cart-loads of rich moveables, moſt part of which belonged to the Jews) who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the Frontiers of <hi>Sileſia,</hi> where having leave for a moneth to refreſh themſelves, they might go to the King of <hi>Poland</hi> (then in <hi>Sileſia</hi>) if they pleaſed; or elſe liſt themſelves in the Swediſh Army: the Citizens alſo agreed to pay 300000 Rixdollars in a moneths time, to the Swediſh King; who for the maintaining of theſe new acqueſts, was very diligent in fortifying all parts, and particularly, the two head Cities of <hi>Warſow</hi> and <hi>Cracovia,</hi> the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> giving order to bring the River <hi>Weyſsel</hi> round about <hi>Cracovia,</hi> whereby it ſhould become very ſtrong.</p>
                     <p>But while <hi>Cracovia</hi> was beſieging, an Envoy from <hi>Koniecpolski,</hi> Standard-bearer to the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> came both to Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate (in his Maſter's name) the Swediſh King, and alſo to let him know, That ſince their King <hi>Caſimir</hi> was fled out of the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the kingdom, without their privity or conſent, they had in conſcience good reaſon to provide them of another King, under whoſe protection they might ſecure themſelves; wherefore his Maſter, both for himſelf, and in behalf of the <hi>Guarcian Militia,</hi> and <hi>Poſpolitans,</hi> and States, did willingly ſubmit unto his Majeſty, to acknowledg him for their Lord and Maſter; and that to the ſame purpoſe, they would ſend Commiſſioners to any place he ſhould appoint: Which he very favourably accepting of, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſend notice of the time and place to the ſaid Standard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer. After which, came news from <hi>Warſovia,</hi> from the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Oxienſtern,</hi> that the Lord <hi>Steinbock</hi> General of the Artillery, had ſubdued the rebellious <hi>Maſsovians:</hi> Alſo another Meſſenger came from the Lord <hi>Dobicky</hi> Palatine of <hi>Sondecki,</hi> offering to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the King's protection; deſiring thereupon, that he would order no more waſte to be made in the kingdom; for ſeeing their King, whom they had ſtood to for the preſervation of their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:33388:284"/>had deſerted them, going out of their borders, they were adviſing among themſelves, to diſpatch within ſix or eight dayes, their Commiſſioners in the name of the whole Nobility, unto his Majeſty, to treat about the peace and ſafety of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Wherefore the King granted to <hi>Leszinski</hi> the great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, and the Palatine <hi>Sandomirienſis,</hi> Letters of ſafe conduct for their free acceſſe unto him for that purpoſe. Who after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> bent his march towards <hi>Lublin,</hi> where the <hi>Coſsacks</hi> with their General, lay encamped: wherein he had a double deſign, partly to make an agreement with them (who now profeſſed a great willingneſſe to ſubmit unto him); the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> alſo being content to retain onely the 3 Palatinates of <hi>Smolensko, Vitebsko,</hi> and <hi>Polosko,</hi> on the other ſide of the River <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> and to abandon the reſt of the great Dukedome of <hi>Lithuania</hi> to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> whereby they would become Maſters of all <hi>Poland;</hi> and partly to be nigh <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> the better to feel the Duke of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> (for he had not as yet joyned in the above-mentioned league with the King) who (he was adviſed) had been under-hand ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the Emperour, to make a ſtrong League with the Eſtates of the ſame Province of <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> and ſome others of <hi>Poland,</hi> that had not as yet abſolutely declared themſelves for the <hi>Swedes:</hi> he being likewiſe adviſed, the Duke had ſent a diſtinct body of an Army towards <hi>Thoren,</hi> to hinder there the <hi>Swedes</hi> irruption; and another body towards <hi>Memmel,</hi> upon the frontiers of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> while the remainder of his Army continued in the heart of <hi>Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fia.</hi> And indeed, before this time, the great progreſs of the <hi>Swedes</hi> in this kingdom, did ſo ſtartle all the Miniſters of the Emperour, that thereupon he (for a time) deferred his journey to <hi>Prague:</hi> and in the mean time, to give ſatisfaction to the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which were held to be juſt. For it was a moſt remarkable providence, that this King ſhould in two or three moneths time even over-run ſo vaſt and warlique a kingdom as <hi>Poland:</hi> but he had as well great policy as valour in the deſign; for when he marched from <hi>Conin</hi> to <hi>Colo,</hi> Aug. 17th; whence he ſent parties to get intelligence of the enemies ſtation and poſture, expecting to meet with the general Leavies at <hi>Ptantek:</hi> a certain Colonel coming in the mean time as an Envoy from the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> with Credentials from him; and audience being given him on the 18th of the ſame, he offered certain Propoſitions in order to a Treaty, uſing theſe expreſſions, (among other formalities) <hi>Pacem petimus, et bellum deprecamur, We requeſt peace, and renounce War;</hi> deſiring for the preſent a Ceſſation of Arms, and that the King would be pleaſed to ſtay there, and move on no farther: He underſtanding the enemie's deſign of delay, becauſe the Envoy was not furniſhed with full power and inſtructions to conclude any thing, departed immediately from <hi>Colo</hi> on the 21 day, to put his warlique deſigns into ſpeedy execution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chmielniski</hi> aſſuring the King (by the Meſſenger ſent unto him) that he would wholly ſubmit unto him, expecting onely his
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:33388:285"/>commands, &amp;c. having alſo quitted <hi>Camietz Podolsky,</hi> as ſoon as he had notice of the king's march into <hi>Poland,</hi> and advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Reuſh Lomberg,</hi> he beat <hi>Podotsky,</hi> a <hi>Polonian,</hi> expecting alſo the King's coming at <hi>Samoisky;</hi> all which, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> himſelf certified one of his chief Officers of, by a letter from the Camp before <hi>Cracovia,</hi> Octob. 14th, the king went towards him, as aforeſaid, who was (after his encamping before <hi>Lublin</hi>) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to <hi>Warſow,</hi> to aſſiſt at a general Dyet of the Palatines and other Lords of the kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> which was ſummoned by the king, who appointed Count <hi>Erick Oxienſtern</hi> his grand Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, with Count <hi>Benedict Oxienſtern,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Berenklow,</hi> to be preſent therein as his Commiſſioners. But in the mean time, the <hi>Coſsacks</hi> (of whom, he was General) coming before the ſaid <hi>Lublin,</hi> Octob. 15. with a huge Army, reported to be 160000 men, hewed down the Jews, plundring out their houſes, fired the fore-Town, and compounded with the Town it ſelf, to have all the Prieſts goods, and thoſe that were fled from <hi>Poland,</hi> and had brought their goods thither; and a ranſome for themſelves; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king alſo an oath of them to be true to the <hi>Muſcoviter,</hi> and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted on the 20th day.</p>
                     <p>Then were the <hi>Swedes</hi> buſie in diſperſing Poliſh parties that got together: as Major General <hi>Steinbock,</hi> who underſtanding that ſome numbers of <hi>Maſsovians</hi> had recollected themſelves, he ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering them, they ſent Deputies unto him for a finall accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Alſo <hi>Lovenhaupt,</hi> another Major General, paſſed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Weyſsel</hi> to encounter ſome Poliſh Troops that were again got together near <hi>Lowick.</hi> Likewiſe 500 Poliſh horſe under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of one <hi>Jalouskie,</hi> being at the ſmall Town of <hi>Wratlaffskie,</hi> and doing ſome hurt to the Inhabitants, the Duke of <hi>Saxon Lawenburg</hi> meeting with them, took <hi>Jalouskie</hi> and the chief of them, diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the reſt.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> coming to <hi>Warſovia,</hi> Octob. 30, continued not long there; for underſtanding that the States and chief Cities of <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> not onely remained obſtinate, but were making a ſtrict League and Combination with the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> againſt him, he committing the management of the buſineſſe of <hi>Poland</hi> with the States there preſent, unto the Rix-Chancellor and ſome others, departed with ſome Regiments and the <hi>Quartians,</hi> unto his Army. At which <hi>Warſovia,</hi> was a dangerous Conſpiracy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, which was to have poyſoned the King and his Nobles, with the whole Garriſon, by infecting all the Conduits and Fountains; for which, ſome great ones, engaged in the Plot, were apprehended, and committed to Cuſtody.</p>
                     <p>But the buſineſſe of <hi>Pruſsia</hi> occaſioned blowes in a ſharp con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict between the <hi>Swedes</hi> and Duke of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> wherein about 5 or 800 of the <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> were ſlain. And which Quarrel, although it was looked on as ominous, it being betwixt two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Reformed Religion, at ſuch a time as that, becauſe it might have induced the Electour to ſome compliance or confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:33388:285"/>with the Poliſh King and the Emperour; yet the Swediſh King proceeded with great reſolution, marching to <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> with whom alſo one Mr. <hi>Rolt</hi> came along, who being ſent from the Engliſh <hi>Protectour,</hi> was received by the King very honourably. Who ſending <hi>Steinbock</hi> before him with his Army, he marching thorow <hi>Marzuria,</hi> with great celerity poſſeſt himſelf of <hi>Straſburg,</hi> the very Key of <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> and of very great advantage to the <hi>Swedes.</hi> After which, <hi>Radzieffky</hi> was ſent with 3000 horſe for <hi>Thoren;</hi> who when he came near the place, finding no <hi>Brandenburgiſh</hi> forces thereabouts, ſent back half his men to the Army, and went with the reſt before <hi>Thoren,</hi> admoniſhing them to obedience: who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſent Deputies to treat for an accommodation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Maſcovites</hi> and <hi>Coſsacks</hi> (in the mean time doing what they could to maintain a good intelligence with the Swediſh King) hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped not a little to the eſtabliſhing and ſecuring his new Conqueſts: moſt alſo of the Poliſh Lords who fled with their King into <hi>Sileſia,</hi> now returning to live under the Swediſh protection. About which time, to wit, about December, the King ſent a Letter to the Emperour, complaining, That he had under-hand applyed himſelf to divers Princes of the Empire, for engaging them in a League to his prejudice. The Emperour diſmiſſed the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with a very civill anſwer, giving him a large aſſurance of holding a good correſpondence with the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> &amp;c. And a Colonel being at that time ſent from the king of <hi>Poland</hi> to raiſe men in the Imperial Territories, the Emperour gave him (for that preſent) very ſtrict order againſt proceeding any further in making leavies. The City of <hi>Elbing</hi> in <hi>Pruſsia</hi> was alſo yielded to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> without any reſiſtance; for the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given audience to the <hi>Imperial</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvanian</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours at the City of <hi>Thoren,</hi> went towards the Town of <hi>Margen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldt:</hi> where the Deputies of <hi>Elbing</hi> attending him, and craving ſome time, the better to conſult with the other Cities in ſo weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty an affair, he flatly denying them, they treated with the Rix-Chancellor on the 9th of December; the agreement of whoſe ſubmiſſion did much ſatisfie the King: who made the ſaid Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour Governour of <hi>Pruſsia;</hi> and General <hi>Linde</hi> Governour of <hi>Elbing,</hi> and the Militia of <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> who Decemb. 12th, placed a conſiderable Garriſon therein. On the 4th day of which moneth at midnight, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had a luſty young Prince born unto him at <hi>Stockholm:</hi> which was the day of his agreement with the City of <hi>Thoren;</hi> whereinto he entred the day following.</p>
                     <p>But the City of <hi>Dantzick</hi> in <hi>Pruſsia</hi> being united in it ſelf, in Decemb. 1655, reſolved upon a defence, in caſe the <hi>Swede</hi> ſhould make any Attempt that way: ſending alſo Inſtructions to their Preſident with the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg;</hi> by all means to make an Agreement with him, thereby to oblige him to relieve them, if aſſaulted, and to aſſiſt them with ſome Troops for the preſent; in order to which defence, they burnt all their Suburbs. And then alſo was the Poliſh King (who had ſome new deſign on foot for
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:33388:286"/>recovery of his kingdom) encreaſing his forces which he had on <hi>Sileſio's</hi> borders: unto whom <hi>Czarneski</hi> the Governour of <hi>Craco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> went with ſome Troops to his ſervice, contrary to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made with the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> upon the ſurrender of the City. But the great Cham of <hi>Tartary,</hi> who was thought would have aſſiſted him to the ſame purpoſe, wrote a Letter to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> aſſuring him, That not any attempt ſhould be made by him or his Souldiers, againſt his progreſſe; but that he was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willing to help and deſtroy his enemies, and eſpecially King <hi>Caſimir</hi> of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>The Swedes being now become Maſters of all <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> except the four Cities of <hi>Dantzick, Marienburg, Putzke,</hi> and <hi>Schlocow; Oxienſtern</hi> the Governour ſent to <hi>Weyer,</hi> who held thoſe places for the Poliſh king, offering him a Treaty in order to a ſurrender, or elſe there would be proceeding to extremity.</p>
                     <p>But, great was the tyranny uſed in great <hi>Poland,</hi> and about <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covia,</hi> about this time, by the <hi>Poles;</hi> both when they lighted on the Swediſh Souldiers, as alſo dividing and cutting children aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der like ſheep, cutting off womens breaſts, then diſſecting them into four quarters; cutting off the hands and feet of Proteſtant Miniſters, then chopping off their heads, and dividing the body into ſeverall quarters, and the hoggs dragging the bowels along the ſtreets; flinging corn alſo upon the ſlain mens fleſh, ſo letting the hoggs run unto it, for increaſing the pleaſure of the tragedy.

                     <p>In the moneth of February, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> paſſed by <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſovia</hi> with three conſiderable Armies towards the <hi>Ukrain</hi> againſt the <hi>Polanders,</hi> having a little before proclaimed, That whoſoever ſhould protect King <hi>Caſimir,</hi> or knowing where he was, would give no notice thereof, ſhould ſuffer death like a Rebel. And on the 21 day of the ſame moneth, the Town of <hi>Marienburg</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to the <hi>Swedes;</hi> and the Caſtle (which holding out, thought to have burnt the City, but was prevented by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants) was after ſome dayes playing upon is, ſurrendred like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> the beſieged underſtanding that an Inhabitant of the City had diſcovered unto them thoſe private wayes and paſſages, whereby they might eaſily make an approach: and alſo that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had two Mines ready to ſpring. On the ſame day, Febr. 21, the <hi>Swedes</hi> obtained no ſmall Victory, whoſe King with 5000 men fighting the <hi>Poles</hi> near <hi>Lublin</hi> and the River <hi>Weyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> routed them, although they fought reſolutely, engaging alſo <hi>Poles</hi> againſt <hi>Poles</hi> in the action; <hi>Czarnecki, Cracovia</hi>'s late Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, commanded the <hi>Polanders,</hi> a great number of whom were ſlain upon the place, and many taken priſoners, with 12 or 13 Standards: the King alſo purſuing them above two miles, killing ſeveral in the purſuit, and many of them were drowned in the Rivers of <hi>Weyſsel</hi> and <hi>Wyppera,</hi> and other waters whither they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated. Others report, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had but ſad work of it; for that, 8000 <hi>Swedes</hi> encountred 20000 <hi>Poles.</hi> And that, as ſoon as the <hi>Coſsacks</hi> (who beheld theſe Combatants afar off) ſaw the Victory to incline to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> they helped to purſue and cut the fugitive <hi>Poles</hi> down. After this, the King advanced to <hi>Lublin,</hi> to take that City; thence preſently towards <hi>Zamoſse,</hi> inſtantly get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that ſtrong and fortified City upon accord: and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced not far from <hi>Zamoſse,</hi> they again meeting with a ſtrong party of <hi>Polanders,</hi> beat them back, diſperſing them, and taking 7.

While the King kept his Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters in and about <hi>Jariſlaw,</hi> much refreſhing his Souldiery thereby, he ſent parties to ſee if the enemies any where did gather a head again; who bringing intelligence, that the <hi>Poles</hi> were eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where turned perjured Rebels, endeavouring to hinder him in his march, cut off all paſſes, and ſtriving by private intelligence with Prieſts and Jeſuits, to reduce the Swediſh Garriſons in great <hi>Poland, Warſovia,</hi> and <hi>Sandomiria,</hi> unto King <hi>Caſimir</hi>'s obedience
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:33388:287"/>the King reſolved to draw back with his Army to a place where they might the better diſcover the enemies plots, and invite him to venture a head battle: and ſending two Commanders, <hi>March</hi> 21, 1655, with orders unto ſome following Troops, to march back towards <hi>Warſovia,</hi> there to remain till his return; himſelf arrived the ſame day before <hi>Sandomir:</hi> but hearing that ſome <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Commanders were the night before become Maſters of the City <hi>Sandomir;</hi> though they could not obtain the Caſtle: whoſe Governour (a <hi>Swede</hi>) afterwards (in revenge) ſetting the Jeſuits Colledg on fire, the whole Town was thereby burnt to aſhes. Yet it ſeems the truer relation, That the <hi>Poles</hi> themſelves firing ſome houſes near the Caſtle; the fire taking hold of the Jeſuits Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, ſeized on the City. Wherefore the King ſending order to the ſaid Governour to leave the Caſtle and croſſe the River <hi>Weyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> with his men, he obeyed; but put a good quantity of Powder and Ammunition (which he could not carry with him) into a Vault locked up, applying thereto a burning match, which might take fire half an hour after his departure. The <hi>Poles</hi> preſently entring the Caſtle, diſplayed their Colours, reviling the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and ſearching into all corners, they found this Vault: which the chief Commander would attribute to himſelf; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in hot diſpute, the powder firing, blew 1200 <hi>Polanders,</hi> (ſome <hi>Swedes</hi> alſo periſhing) with the Caſtle roofs, into the ayr; the King on the other ſide of the River being a ſpectator: who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding on the 23 day, that <hi>Keniecpoliski</hi> ſhewed himſelf with about 12000 <hi>Quartians</hi> betwixt <hi>Landſhut</hi> and the <hi>King's Camp,</hi> drew out 16 Regiments of horſe, and 14 Companies of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, to meet the enemy, and charging them home, diſperſed the whole Army, taking many colours from them, beating alſo <hi>Witepski,</hi> who diſputed the Paſſe over <hi>San,</hi> to the King: after which, he purpoſed to paſſe the river <hi>Weyſsel</hi> 10 miles beyond <hi>Warſovia,</hi> to have a third bout with the Crown Marſhal <hi>Lubomir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ski.</hi> There having been two Embaſſadours at <hi>Jariſlaw</hi> from <hi>Chmiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niski</hi> General of the <hi>Coſsacks,</hi> who arrived there the 8th of the ſame moneth, aſſuring the King by letters, that as ſoon as the earth was endued with her green robes, he would attend him with 50 thouſand men.</p>
                     <p>April 11. following, 1656, the Marqueſſe of <hi>Baden</hi> going from <hi>Warſovia</hi> with his Troops to joyn with the King, he chanced to meet with about 12000 <hi>Poles</hi> under <hi>Lubomirski's</hi> Banner, about 8. miles from the City, they were 10 for one; yet the Marqueſſes men maintaining the fight above two hours before they quitted the field, killed above 2000 Poles: then ſaving themſelves by flight, Field-Marſhall <hi>Wrangle</hi>'s Troops meeting with them, and ſecuring them, they ſaved likewiſe a good part of their baggage; yet theſe few were moſt cut in pieces in the action, the Marqueſs himſelf very narrowly eſcaping.</p>
                     <p>The ſame moneth of April, the King beating and ſubduing the rebellious <hi>Maſures,</hi> with all that adhered to them, arrived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:33388:287"/>the end of the moneth, at <hi>Thoren:</hi> about which time, the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> ſent the King a letter by an Envoy, aſſuring him of his reall friendſhip, having 16000 men ready upon the borders under <hi>Backos Gabor</hi>'s command, who were at his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                     <p>Then alſo in <hi>France,</hi> falſe newes being there ſpread of the total defeat of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and the King himſelf being ſlain by the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> the people of <hi>Orleance</hi> were ſo tranſported with joy thereat; that they made ſolemn Feaſts, diſtributing a good ſum of mony to the poor on that account, whereby the vulgar were emboldened to ſay, They muſt even take the ſame courſe with the Hereticks in <hi>France.</hi> But when through the Meſſenger's lameneſſe in affirming they were ſomewhat cooled, they were madly incenſed again through the ſpreading of a rumour, that the Engliſh had leave, and did begin to build a place of publique aſſembly at <hi>Rochel,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That they ever foreſaw, if a peace were concluded once with the <hi>Protectour</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> it would tend to encourage and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the <hi>Hugonots;</hi> making them ſoon dare to attempt any thing that might ſubvert the Catholique profeſſion and intereſt: ſo that the Governour of <hi>Orleance</hi> was fain (at the Proteſtants requeſt) to appoint a guard; they not being ſafe in repairing to the publique aſſembly, by reaſon of the peoples fury. The new Pope, <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the 7th, having alſo about the ſame time (for it was dated at <hi>Rome, March</hi> 20th) ſent a Brief or Letter to the general Aſſembly of the French Clergy, exhorting them to ſtirt up the King to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace: which was judged to be but as a fire-ball thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> under that pretence, to put the Clergy and people into combuſtion: which by prudence was broken, and did no hurt.</p>
                     <p>But the Caſtle of <hi>Branbergh</hi> in <hi>Peland</hi> being ſurrendred by the <hi>Swedes</hi> at diſcretion, the <hi>Polanders</hi> branded them all with a mark on their fore-heads; which indignity was much reſented by their party.

<pb n="562" facs="tcp:33388:288"/>and utterly demoliſhed the Caſtle. Thence marching to <hi>Godzier</hi> Caſtle, the Gentry and Peaſants therein, after firing on thoſe who were ſent afore, left the Caſtle. The enemy turning towards <hi>Gneſen,</hi> after an intent to ſurprize <hi>Poſen,</hi> (in which they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the Citie's being well provided, and the Suburbs burnt down) <hi>Stareſta Braſlowsky</hi> ſent a Meſſenger to <hi>Wrſezewitz,</hi> whom Prince <hi>Adolph</hi> had ſent with a party towards <hi>Gneſen,</hi> that expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Swediſh Army, they would ſtand and give them battel. Wherefore <hi>Adolph</hi> ſending the forlorn-hope to get ſome priſeners, (though they were repulſed) marching with his Army over a paſſage unreſiſted, put his men into a Battalia; himſelf commanding the right wing, Field-Marſhal <hi>Wrangle</hi> the left: who at the advance approaching ſo nigh the enemy, becauſe the Princes not being able to come in at the ſide for the mooriſhneſs of the place, the foremoſt ſquadrons were preſently ſcattered: which the enemie's Avant-Troops (too deeply engaged with the Swediſh Avant-Troops) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and being luſtily plaid on by the Dragoons in ambuſh, they beginning to retreat, came ſo directly between both the Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh wings, that moſt of them were deſtroyed: the right wing thereupon advancing, (and becauſe the enemy ſtill retreated over a water to a Village called <hi>Gietzmarky,</hi> where he rallyed again together with the <hi>Poſtpolitans</hi>) ſome Ordnance being planted on a high ground, were diſcharged againſt the enemy, whileſt the Swedes getting over the water, came to a full Front; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the enemy coming furiouſly on with a great ſhout, attempted ſundry wayes to diſorder the Swediſh Army.

<pb n="565" facs="tcp:33388:289"/>a ſimple ſelf-defence, and not took upon them to have hindered his progreſs; (for they, whatever elſe, had endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Marienburgh</hi> Caſtle) alſo telling them, after divers conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations laid down, If they could reap no other benefit by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſucceſſe, in their deſigns, than the rooting out of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of truth; and that, by the bringing in of the ſuperſtitious Roman Religion again; might not onely be feared the loſſe of their own ſouls, but alſo a total ruine of their Trade, and the Citie's welfare: wherefore he could not conjecture how they might excuſe ſuch dangerous enterpriſes and deſigns to poſterity. They returned divers, not unſober, expreſſions in anſwer; ſaying, They were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in their conſciences, that they have not afforded the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to that miſerable War, &amp;c. alſo mentioning 5 principall Maxims which their Predeceſſours, and they, in imitation of them, had alway made their chiefeſt work to conſider; 1. To main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Goſpel of Truth. 2. To be faithful to their King. 3. To keep firm to the Crown of <hi>Poland.</hi> 4. To defend their Laws, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, &amp;c. 5. To preſerve and increaſe the welfare of that City. They ſaid, they did confidently believe, that none could impute it to them, as if God took pleaſure in Apoſtates and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and as if he would have Religion promoted in caſting off the lawful Magiſtrate, and in the ſlender eſteem of a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Government: and that according to their judgments, there was nothing more wholeſome and proſperous than Peace, to preſerve and propagate Religion, which the Prince of Peace had ſo earneſtly recommended to all thoſe who would truly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. They adding moreover, That the Duke himſelf (being perfectly well verſed in Hiſtory) would be pleaſed to call to mind, how that at all times, by Wars, the ſpirits of men grew more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and inhumane; and how, the Wars for Religion, uſed commonly to extinguiſh Religion. Concluding with a hope, that the Duke would be pleaſed, from their aboveſaid reaſons, and his own intereſt, to co-operate to the mitigation of the <hi>Swede's</hi> great ſpirits: and that they would do their beſt endeavours humbly to perfwade their King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> and the Nobles of that Kingdom, not to refuſe reaſonable means to attain peace; but rather to find out all poſſible means to compaſſe it: and not doubting, but their King and the States would be very inclinable thereunto.</p>
                     <p>This Summer, 1656, there was ſuch a mortal Peſtilence in the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> that ſome dayes 6000 people were ſaid to dye of it therein. The Peſtilence was then alſo ſo raging in all places poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the Turks in the Iſland of <hi>Candia,</hi> that they were forced to abandon divers Towns which they there held, and to leave them deſolate.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time, July 16, the <hi>French</hi> received a great loſs before <hi>Valenchienne,</hi> which they had beſieged; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> frequently ſhewing as if they would fall upon Marſhal <hi>Turein</hi>'s and the <hi>Lorrainer</hi>'s quarter; at laſt fell in good earneſt upon Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall <hi>de la Ferte</hi>'s quarter: who coming reſolutely on, had three
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:33388:290"/>or four repulſes by the French their notable reſiſtance: and when the <hi>Spaniard</hi> afterwards had fallen in among them, they ſo fought it out, that of 1200 in <hi>Du Pleſsis</hi> Regiment, there remained but 30 men. The whole Regiments of <hi>Le Ferte</hi> and <hi>Piedmont;</hi> ten Companies of the King's guards, and the Cardinai's guards, with <hi>La Ferte</hi>'s Dragoons alſo which were near 800, and his Regiment of horſe, 1200, were all cut in pieces. Likewiſe the <hi>Switzers</hi> Regiments, 800 of whom eſcaping the ſword, were drowned by water coming into their Trenches at the ſudden opening of the ſluces: and whereby, all commerce betwixt the two bodies of the French Army was intercepted: ſo that <hi>Turein</hi> being forced to ſtand all the while a Spectatour, at length drew off all his (being about 12000) men to <hi>Queſnoy,</hi> a garriſon about two leagues from <hi>Valenchienne,</hi> where next morning came to him betwixt ſix and ſeven thouſand recruits, who had thought to have united with him at the ſiege. The Marqueſs of <hi>Eſtree</hi> was ſlain in this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and the Count his brother taken priſoner, beſides many Marqueſſes, Counts, and other great perſons, and Officers killed or taken: and <hi>La Ferte</hi> himſelf, being wounded in the thigh, was taken priſoner.</p>
                     <p>Things in <hi>Germany</hi> went then worſe with the Proteſtants than formerly; for at <hi>Collen,</hi> in the ſame moneth of July, ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of them were diſtrained, becauſe that after three ſummons, they refuſed to pay their fine, for not ſtrewing Flowers before their houſes on the Sacrament day, when the Hoſt was carried thorow the ſtreet; which had not been exacted in 30 years. It was likewiſe moved and deliberated in the Council of that City, to turn all the ſaid Proteſtants after a years warning, out of the City, ſo ſoon as the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> was expired.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Dane</hi> and the States of the United Provinces now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood each other, as to providing that the <hi>Swede</hi> grew not too potent in or near the Baltick Seas: and that King ſtanding in very good terms with thoſe States, gave their Embaſſadours hopes, that 10 of his Men of War ſhould joyn with theirs upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>In Auguſt following, againſt the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> (who had a little before declared to an Envoy, (ſent unto him from the grand Cham of <hi>Tartarie,</hi> to perſwade him from any agreement with the Swediſh King) that ſince he was totally abandoned by the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> he thought himſelf concerned to take a courſe for conſervation of his Eſtates held in <hi>Pruſsia</hi>) a Sentence was pronounced from a Verdict of the Imperiall Chamber in <hi>Germany,</hi> in reference to the War made in 1653, (as we have declared in the foregoing Chapter) againſt the Duke of <hi>Newburgh;</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judged guilty of giving the firſt occaſion thereof, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to pay towards the charges, 200000 Rixdollars to the ſaid Duke of <hi>Newburgh;</hi> and in default of payment, his Land of <hi>March</hi> ſhould be mortgaged.</p>
                     <p>But the King of <hi>Poland</hi> coming afreſh upon the City of <hi>Warſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
                        <pb n="567" facs="tcp:33388:290"/>after its relief; it was yielded up to him July the firſt; the <hi>Swedes</hi> being to leave their booties and plunder behind them, with the Artillery, and what belonged thereunto; Gen. <hi>Wittenberg</hi> marching out with 4000 Swedes: the women were civilly uſed, and had ſome inferiour Officers granted them to bring them to the Swediſh Camp: yet all the conditions were not kept; which was to be attributed to the roughneſſe of the Poliſh Souldiery, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to King <hi>Caſimir.</hi> At the ſame time <hi>Cracovia</hi> alſo was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagured and hardly put to it by the Queen of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Army; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe Camp the King her husband had ſent 8000 men; and whom to meet at <hi>Warſovia,</hi> ſhe perſonally departed from before <hi>Cracovia.</hi> The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> being ſtill encamped at <hi>Nowedwor,</hi> (from whence came intelligence into <hi>England,</hi> of ſome particular Succeſſes againſt <hi>Poliſh</hi> parties, obtained by that Army who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched from <hi>Thoren</hi> May 30th, to relieve <hi>Warſovia</hi>) where the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> joyned his Forces to his, July 7th; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to fall ſuddenly into King <hi>Caſimir</hi>'s Camp, although he gave out to be above 100000 men. Who becauſe of his great numbers, not much regarding the forces of the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> and the Electour, on July 27, 1656, ſent a Body of <hi>Tartars</hi> (for theſe were united with him) to beſiege <hi>Poltowsko:</hi> whereupon the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſeeing an opportunity of action, drew out their forces to relieve the City: which was performed with ſlaughter among the beſieging <hi>Tartars.</hi> July 28, the King and the Electour croſſing the River <hi>Buck,</hi> drew up their Army in Battalia, advancing towards the <hi>Poles:</hi> King <hi>Caſimir</hi> ſtanding (with 150000 or 120000) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them: where, after ſome light skirmiſhes betwixt their forlorns, and more engagements, till night parted them, and in which firſt encounters the <hi>Swedes</hi> had the worſt; (though they valiantly repulſed a body of <hi>Tartars</hi> ſent to fall on their rear) next day, July 29, a grand battle beginning, one of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Wings at firſt, ſeemed to be declining; but recovering their wonted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage by others ſent to ſuccour them, (though the <hi>Poles</hi> came on ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry numerouſly and furiouſly) they kept their ground. The Battle continuing all this day, untill the next, July 30th, in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the King and the Electour (who behaved himſelf valiantly) had a marvellous Victory; for the <hi>Poland</hi> King loſing a great part of his foot, all his Ordnance and baggage, and leaving the City of <hi>Warſovia</hi> open to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> fled after his horſe, with a few in his company, into <hi>Podlachia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, that ſtrong and important Garriſon of <hi>Conde</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> was yielded up by the <hi>French</hi> to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Articles after no ſhort ſiege.</p>
                     <p>News being come to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> in July, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> had broken into the Province of <hi>Ingermanland,</hi> the Eſtates of <hi>Sweden</hi> here aſſembling, ordered all Governours to provide, and ſpeedily ſend all ſorts of Ammunition into that Province, as alſo into <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Liefland;</hi> and although they reſolved not to proceed againſt the <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> before they ſaw he was become an abſolute
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:33388:291"/>enemy; yet in the mean time, they aſſured themſelves of the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> living in <hi>Stockholm,</hi> beginning to ſeize all their Eſtates and Merchandizes, and impriſoning ſome, for imbezilling part of their goods: and hearing ſoon after, that the <hi>Maſcovite</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into <hi>Liefland,</hi> and what he had done upon it, they laboured with all poſſible diligence to take ſome courſe for reſcuing that Province out of the Jawes of thoſe devouring enemies; not onely fending forces to ſtrengthen the moſt important Towns, but rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing men in ſeveral parts of <hi>Sweden:</hi> the Nobility and Citizens with great cheerfulneſſe agreeing to contribute twice as much (upon this occaſion) as they were wont to do in the foregoing years. And indeed, things went but ill with the <hi>Swedes</hi> in <hi>Poland</hi> now, becauſe (for that preſent) the King was conſtrained to draw a way the main of his forces with ſpeed into <hi>Liefland;</hi> though he left ſufficient to maintain all their Garriſons except <hi>Warſovia,</hi> which they ſlighted, demoliſhing its fortifications; ſo, forſaking all on this ſide the River <hi>Weyſsell.</hi> The Electour of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> was to ſecure <hi>Pruſsia;</hi> but <hi>Poland</hi> was left to the diſpoſure of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: ſo that it was obſerved, that the <hi>Poliſh</hi> King had been (in all probability) ſoon driven out of his Dominion, or forced to accept Conditions of peace, had not this fierce invaſion of the great Duke fallen out: who toward the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1656, ſate down before <hi>Riga,</hi> (the chief City of the Province of <hi>Liefland</hi>) but about a ſtones caſt from it, (and with an Army ſo numerous, that the Conſul of the City having gone up to the loftieſt Tower thereof, to view them at their approach beheld them with admiration, as exceeding (he certified in his letter) the Graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in number) who ſent in a Trumpeter to the Citizens with a proud Meſſage, That if they would ſubmit and ſupplicate for cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, they might have it; but if obſtinately ſtanding out, they muſt expect nothing but ruine and deſtruction. The Swediſh Souldiers there in Garriſon were but 1500; but the Citizens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolved men, liſted 4000, and perſons of good eſtate, who were in arms: the City being alſo well provided with neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and their Fortifications compleated, they ſaid, they feared no force; yet they expected relief from the King of <hi>Sweden:</hi> which the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> laboured to prevent, by intending to build Forts between the City and the mouth of the River <hi>Duna.</hi> And amongſt other barbarous proceedings of the <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> taken for certain, the Count of <hi>Thurne</hi> (who married <hi>Bannier</hi>'s Widow, the great Swediſh General in the <hi>German</hi> Wars, and ſiſter to the Marqueſs of <hi>Baden</hi>) being abroad out of <hi>Riga</hi> with a party of 300 horſe, was at their firſt coming thither met with: who being defeated and taken, they cut off his head, and fixed it on a Spear to ſhew it the befieged; though the trunk of his body was by the enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance conveyed into the City.</p>
                     <p>On the very ſame day, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 28, was the City and Caſtle of <hi>Cracovia</hi> ſaid to be ſurrendred to the Poliſh and Auſtrian forces; but on very good terms: as not onely for the Swedes to carry
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:33388:291"/>away what they could upon all the horſes in the City; but to be ſupplyed with 200 more by the <hi>Polanders,</hi> to carry their baggage, and to be conveyed with 1200 horſe and foot to <hi>Greſsen,</hi> &amp;c. But as for the Arians and Jews that were in the City, the former were to petition for pardon, and having their goods exempted from confifcation, their perſons to be baniſhed; but the latter were to be left to the King of <hi>Poland</hi>'s mercy.</p>
                     <p>But about the beginning of Sept following, Prince <hi>Adolph</hi> with his forces fucceſsfully encountred 2000 ſallyers out of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> (who had a deſign uyon the Bridg under <hi>Dirſhaw</hi>) with a ſmall loſſe: the <hi>Dantzick</hi> norſe and Dragoons timely running, but the party of foot fighting ſtoutly: who notwithſtanding, had been all loſt, if they had not met with a Marſh, to which they retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; five Colours, ſeven pieces of Ordnance, with all their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, were taken, and above 200 priſoners, but far more ſlain; 200 alſo retreating between the water, where they were ſhut up, were expected ſoon to yield.</p>
                     <p>But that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> (who had ſufficiently engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in undertaking ſo great a Conqueſt as the Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi>) might be deeper engaged; the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who had before made preparations, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>re this, as a third enemy, come upon his back both by Sea and Land: ſo that, before the middle of September there was a great fight at Sea between the <hi>Daniſh</hi> and <hi>Swediſh</hi> Fleets: the <hi>Swedes</hi> having 44 ſhips in all, to wit, 33 great Men of War, the other ſomewhat leſſe, with two fire-ſhips. Of the Daniſh Fleet I am not certain of their number, (but 22 ſayl were ſeen not far from the Iſland <hi>Mone</hi> before the fight began) who when they ſaw the Swediſh about the <hi>Hilden</hi> Sea, began to retreat, ſteering for <hi>Coppenhaguen;</hi> but being purſued by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> they were forced to engage: the fight beginning about two of the clock in the afternoon, and continuing till night, and a good while with much reſolution on each ſide; four ſhips being related to be blown up into the ayr, and the Swedes getting the day.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> poſſeſſing <hi>Cracovia,</hi> preſently ſent a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier or Poſt to <hi>Dantzick,</hi> as to give them an account thereof, ſo promiſing them, that <hi>Czarnecky</hi> ſhould with his choyceſt horſe, ſhortly ſtrike into <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and <hi>Lubermisky</hi> ſhould with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrian forces fall into <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> to divert the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and call him out of the Daniſh Dominions; wherefore the Swediſh King haſtening to <hi>Wiſmar</hi> in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> to put all things there in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of defence, came thither Sept. 14, he leaving his Army to carry on the War againſt <hi>Denmark,</hi> under the Command of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Wrangell.</hi> And, to reſtore life and ſpirit to the Swediſh affairs then doubtful, if not drooping, one Father <hi>Daniel,</hi> an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the <hi>Coſsacks,</hi> came from their General <hi>Chmielniski</hi> to the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſome dayes before, to aſſure him, that the ſaid General was upon his march with 24000 men for his aſſiſtance, as was certified by a Poſt from <hi>Elbing</hi> in <hi>Pruſsia</hi> to the City of <hi>Bremen,</hi> Sept. the 7th; who alſo brought news, that the Prince of
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:33388:292"/>
                        <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> was ready with an Army of 40000 men for ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit againſt the Poliſh King, or (for the Auſtrians were joyned with the Poles) againſt the Emperour.</p>
                     <p>About or in the moneth of April, 1656, there were great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and tumults (raiſed by 20000 Janizaries and Saphies) at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> (ſaid to be occaſioned through want of pay, and the obtruding on them a new Coyn of a very baſe Allay) who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far as to maſſacre divers of the grand Seignior's Divan or Councel, and to depoſe and ſtrangle the Viſier Baſſa, whoſe carkaſe they with ſcorn expoſed in the Market-place: forcing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Sultana, Mother of the grand Signior, to fly to the old Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio for ſecurity: the Mufti or chief Prieſt being fain likewiſe to ſave himſelf by flight; not daring to truſt the words of thoſe Mutineers, whoſe deſign was to have dethroned the grand Seignior, and to have eſtabliſhed his brother in his place. They laying aſide alſo all other principal Officers of the Empire, to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt a deſerved puniſhment, choſe others in their places who were at their devotion: and ſearched diligently after ſuch great Officers who eſcaped their hands: and all things there were then in ſo great confuſion, that ſome ſtrange alteration of affairs among them was expected; ſo that although this might have been enough to give a ſtop to the Turk's proceedings againſt the <hi>Venetians;</hi> yet the new ones in power went on with their prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations againſt their intereſt in <hi>Candia</hi> with more vigour than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſo that the Republique of <hi>Venice</hi> was fain to ſend ſpeedily away Prince <hi>Horatio Farneſe,</hi> and other chief Commanders with good numbers of men, and ſtore of Ammunition for maintaining of what they held in that Iſle. The Turks alſo then coming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Bagnaluch,</hi> making great Magazines at <hi>Clivane,</hi> with eight great Artillery pieces, and 1000 yoaks of Oxen to draw them for the beſieging of <hi>Sebenico,</hi> they ordered <hi>Antonio Bernardo</hi> to go with all ſpeed into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> as Commiſſary General, to aſſiſt the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Zeno.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But within two or three moneths after, thoſe Tumults in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> being appeaſed, the Grand Seignior making a ſtately Cavalcate throughout the City, at that time, gave order, for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting divers of the Ring-leaders in the ſaid diſorders, for greater terrour to the people in time to come: diſpatching alſo away a Courrier in all haſte to the Baſhaw of <hi>Damaſco,</hi> requiring him ſpeedily to come away and take on him the ſlain grand Viſier's Office; which great place was conferred on him, although but 24 years of age, becauſe of his great abilities already ſhewn in the places of his Government. Who about the moneth of June, being fetcht into <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with great pomp and ſolemnities made at his inſtalling into the ſaid Office; preſently after, that Turkiſh Fleet was recruited with men, money, and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; over which the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet obtained a great and notable Victory, June 26, 1656, who having made one moneths ſtay in the mouth of the <hi>Dardanelles,</hi> to wait for, and fight the enemy, (ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:33388:292"/>Galleys of <hi>Malta</hi> arriving in the mean time) the Turk's Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Baſſa appeared in ſight of the Caſtles, his Fleet conſiſting of 28 great ſhips, 60 Galleys, 9 Galeaſſes, and other ſmall Veſſels. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Navy had 28 great Ships, 24 Galleys, 7 Galeaſſes, (beſides thoſe of <hi>Malta</hi> aforeſaid) commanded by the Prior of <hi>Roccelia;</hi> who keeping in the narroweſt part of the Channell, the Turks could not come forth without accepting the offered battels. The Baſſa (at firſt) had raiſed two Batteries on Land on both ſides the River, one on <hi>Natolia</hi> ſide, the other on the ſide of <hi>Greece,</hi> as thinking to facilitate their own going forth, by obliging the other to forſake their ſtation: yet the <hi>Venetians</hi> undauntedly reſiſting their ſhot, rendred that advantage of theirs unprofitable: wherefore the Baſſa (being expreſly ordered to attempt going out) on the 26th day in the morning, through a pleaſant North-wind advanced all his great Ships, who withdrew notwithſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Point of <hi>Barbiera;</hi> whither the Baſſa himſelf repaired with his Galleys: a few hours after, through a ſmall North-weſt wind, the <hi>Venetian</hi> Navy moving, <hi>Eleazar Moccenigo,</hi> now a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteer, and commanding the left Wing, advancing and paſſing beyond the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet, fought valiantly, endeavouring to hinder its retreat. The battel being begun, <hi>Laurence Marcello</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> General, with him of <hi>Malta,</hi> intermingling with the other <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Veſſels, fell to it Pell-mell; ſo that the Turks being hemmed in, and no place to eſcape, were forced to fight with the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs: but they were wholly routed by ſword, fire, and water, the Captain Baſſa ſaving himſelf with onely 14 Galleys; 40 Galleys were taken in the fight, 10 ſunk and burnt; alſo 9 Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hones were taken; but the 28 great Ships were (for the moſt) burnt. The number of the Turks ſlain could hardly be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: yet 5000 were judged to be killed; 4 or 5000 Chriſtian ſlaves being releaſed, and 4000 Turks made ſlaves. The <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian's</hi> loſs being their chief Captain <hi>Marcello,</hi> 300 Souldiers and Marriners; 3 Ships of theirs likewiſe were burnt, two in fight, and one by an accident. After an extroardinary joy manifeſted by the Duke and City of <hi>Venice,</hi> the Senate ordered for releaſing of all priſoners for debt; ſome of the Banditi being freed alſo: and <hi>Moccenigo,</hi> who had contributed much to the gaining of the Victory, was the firſt that was Knighted by the Senate, with a chain of gold of 2000 Crowns conferred on him; and then was declared Generaliſſimo in the room of ſlain <hi>Marcello;</hi> in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of whom, a publique ſervice was ordered to be celebrated at the publique charge.</p>
                     <p>About the moneths of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> (whoſe Son, the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> aſſiſted the <hi>Pole</hi> at the taking of <hi>Cracovia</hi>) was very ſtrong in forces, as if he intended ſome great deſign: the number of whoſe Regiments of horſe were 9550 men; of his foot 25300; and in the ſeveral places within his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious which were Garriſoned, or to be made Garriſons, (to wit, in <hi>Bohemia, Moravia,</hi> the Upper and Nether <hi>Sileſia,</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> there diſpoſed in divers places, and upon the Turk's borders) were
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:33388:293"/>appointed to defend them, 19750 men: who alſo about Sept. fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſent 11 Regiments of Horſe and foot out of his Regiments, yet levying 10 new ones in his hereditary Countries in their ſtead; 44 Troops of the one, and 66 Companies of the other, under General <hi>Enkenford,</hi> to ayd the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in <hi>Millain</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> againſt the <hi>French</hi> and Duke of <hi>Modena;</hi> reſolving to ſet out a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> concerning that deſign: The <hi>French</hi> having luſtily ſtruggled againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> beſieged by them, in the City of <hi>Valentia,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> preparing to meet the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour's forces with great courage and reſolution. A little before which, the ſaid Emperour ſending an Expreſſe to demand of the King of <hi>France,</hi> the payment of three millions of Crowns, which he was obliged to do by the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi> or elſe to ſurrender up <hi>Briſac</hi> and all <hi>Alſatia,</hi> it occaſioned the enemies of <hi>France</hi> to raiſe rumours, that the Emperour intended to ſend an Army for recovery of <hi>Alſatia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About the ſame time, ſome Theeves in the Turkiſh Dominions ſet fire on the Seraglio of <hi>Boſnia,</hi> 4000 houſes, 4 Dovens of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome-houſes, and 3 Moſquees being burned down to the ground, and the Jews quarter was plundred. And at the City of <hi>Luca</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> one <hi>Piſani</hi> a Traytour was executed to death, for attempting to kill all the Nobility, and change the Government of that little Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>But the Princes of the Empire were not well pleaſed with this ſo haſty undertaking of the Emperour in Italy, and without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding their advice in a buſineſs ſo important, and prejudiciall to the Empire; alſo ſo contrary to the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly mentioning, That the Dukes of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Modena,</hi> ſhall be free to make War, the Emperour not to ſend any forces againſt them, without the Princes Electours their conſent: who were ſo far from that, that they proteſted againſt this ſending, as a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt violation of that Treaty of peace ſo ſolemnly ſworn, and that which could have no other effect than the troubling of <hi>Germany,</hi> and reviving of War: neither (it appears) were (whatever the cauſe was) ſome of the Souldiers well pleaſed with their going; for two Regiments at a general Muſter of them, mutined and disbanded; although ſome of them were therefore taken and hanged.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1655, Septemb. 20, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 7th (who had lately entred into the Popedome, endeavoured to bring about a general Peace among the Princes addicted to him; writing Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alſo to the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> to that end) wrote a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to all the Popiſh Clergy throughout Chriſtendom, to ſtir them up to uſe all means for procurement of a ſettlement of the ſaid Peace.</p>
                     <p>But in <hi>Helvetia</hi> or <hi>Switzerland,</hi> (which Country being governed after a Democratical form, is divided into 13 Cantons or Baily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks, five of whom have been eſteemed wholly Papiſts, ſix wholly Proteſtants, and the other two mixt of both: which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:33388:293"/>began about or in the year 1519, when <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Zurich</hi> or <hi>Tigurum,</hi> ſeconded <hi>Luther</hi>'s beginning: which the reſt of this people not liking, moved War with them of <hi>Zurich,</hi> and the reſt of the Proteſtants, in which, <hi>Zuinglius</hi> himſelf was ſlain, (for it was the cuſtome of the place, for the Miniſters to go in the Front of their Armies, and he alſo of a bold ſpirit) and the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurines</hi> diſcomfited; yet in the year 1531, an abſolute Peace was concluded betwixt them: whereby notwithſtanding the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Religion, they lived in unity the Proteſtant profeſſours there, being firſt offended, began <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o arm themſelves againſt the Popiſh Cantons in 1655; for beſides the differences which the Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins there excited, and which every where increaſed, divers in the Popiſh Canton of <hi>Switz,</hi> as alſo ſome in <hi>Lucerne,</hi> (who were called <hi>Nicodemites,</hi> becauſe they at firſt ſecretly owned the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Articles of faith; yet afterwards openly profeſſed the ſame) were impriſoned, (the Popiſh Cantons alſo ſolemnly ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their religious alliance againſt thoſe in <hi>Lucerne</hi>) and by thoſe of <hi>Switz</hi> very cruelly handled: ſome of whom eſcaping out of the priſons, deteſted their cruelties and idolatry; which confirmed the reſt; the other yet in priſon being alſo very conſtant in their faith: one of the notableſt young men named <hi>Sebaſtian Anna Mouſnier,</hi> a priſoner in the Town of <hi>Switz,</hi> eſcaping out at one of the Water-paſſages, as the Popiſh were in the midſt of their <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> revels, on the Sunday, after many tortures and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries undergone. The <hi>Nicodemites</hi> ſo called, coming out of <hi>Switz</hi> into <hi>Zurick,</hi> made their profeſſion very diſtinctly (about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of October there, 1655,) upon all the Articles of faith, and ſo labouring to confirm them by Texts of Scripture. About the ſame time, thoſe of <hi>Lucerne</hi> releaſed them that they had in priſon; though upon what conditions was not then known: yet thoſe who were ſet at liberty, continued as firm and fervent as ever: one was likewiſe laid hold on for reading the Bible.</p>
                     <p>Neither were the Papiſts themſelves free from differences amongſt each other; for when the foreſaid League was ſworn againſt thoſe at <hi>Lucerne,</hi> the ſwearers choſe one <hi>Charls Boromeo</hi> a <hi>Milanois,</hi> to be their Advocate and Patron, publiſhing a Patent to that purpoſe, declaring the reaſons of that their new idolatry: at which, many of their Popiſh brethren were ſo offended, that they entred into an oath and combination againſt that new <hi>Italian</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, reſolving to adhere to the old. But the Popiſh Cantons (at firſt) arming themſelves inſenſibly, ſought every way for friends and aſſiſtance; ſending Deputies to the Biſhop of <hi>Baſile,</hi> to procure him toſwear their League againſt the Proteſtants: <hi>Milain</hi> offering them men to the laſt, and <hi>Rome</hi> money; but the reſt of their friends would do but little.</p>
                     <p>About November following, the <hi>Zurickers</hi> had intelligence that ſome of the <hi>Nicodemites</hi> were at <hi>Switz,</hi> to be executed to death, if the preſence of the Proteſtant <hi>Cantons</hi> Deputies did not hinder the
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:33388:294"/>ſame; wherefore they were wonderouſly reſolved to oppoſe that Fury: the mixt Canton of Appenzel, who were then 5000 ſtrong, and the Papiſts but 1500, reſolving to turn out the Nuns, which made the Monks to mourn, as to be deprived of their wonted vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits. The ſecond Deputies being ſent to <hi>Switz,</hi> had indeed a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Audience; But they propoſing reſtitution to be made of the goods of thoſe departed from <hi>Switz,</hi> for Religion ſake, as it had been formerly done by the Proteſtant party, towards all ſuch as had relinquiſhed the Proteſtant profeſſion, whom they treated with all civility when they were impriſoned on the like occaſion: the Town of <hi>Switz</hi> denied them, ſaying, They being in Soveraign State, had a right to proceed as they judged meet againſt their Subjects; becauſe thoſe who deſerted them were perjured and Apoſtates, &amp;c. and being legally cited, had refuſed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; wherefore their goods were juſtly confiſcated: and that with thoſe whom they had in priſon for the ſame ſault, they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to the nature of their offences. The Proteſtant Deputies being aſtoniſhed hereat, after ſome conference, propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that ſince they would not condiſcend in a friendly way, they would referre the whole matter fordetermination, to the Law of all <hi>Switzer-land:</hi> which they likewiſe peeviſhly and ſcornfully enough refuſing, the Deputies departed, but ill ſatified: and not onely the other Proteſtant Cantons, with no ſmall regreat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but even 3 Popiſh ones did not approve of the violence, wherewith the <hi>Switzers</hi> mindes were poſſeſſed, and what troubles they of <hi>Zurick</hi> endured from them, for above 2 years before, yet they thought fit to own them in the quarrel of Religion: who then all armed apace, and had done ſome affronts and injuries to the Proteſtant Cantons in a very particular manner, (though their Magiſtrates offered Chaſtiſement, ſeeming to be diſpleaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at) wherefore the Proteſtants putting themſelves into a poſture, obſerved all their proceedings, and on the 14th of the ſaid No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, appointed an Aſſembly to begin, to deliberate touching that great affaire, and alſo of the other grievances and oppreſſions. Alſo on of the 12th of this month, moſt of the Deputies of the Cantons meeting at <hi>Baden,</hi> (divers Papiſts being abſent, becauſe of ſome Holidays by them obſerved) the French Ambaſſadour, <hi>De la Barde</hi> came thither from <hi>Saloturne,</hi> where, in a ſpeech, he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly exhorting them to union, afterwards entertained them at a banquet. But the Deputies of <hi>Zurick</hi> having declared their Complaints againſt <hi>Suitz:</hi> they could get no other anſwer from them, but, that they were Soveraigns in their own Country, and if they roaſted their Subjects they needed not to give any account of their Actions. The <hi>Zurickers</hi> replied, if ye give us not a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anſwer, we ſhall be conſtrained to uſe ſuch meanes as God hath given us: So offering to leave <hi>Baden,</hi> and go home to order their Army preſently, to march out of <hi>Zurick</hi> into the Field; but the other Proteſtant Deputies, and ſome alſo of the more moderate
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:33388:294"/>Popiſh ones, prevailed with them to tarrie: promiſing their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to draw <hi>Switz</hi> to ſome reaſon. <hi>Auſtria</hi> threatned the Proteſtants; but their Neighbour-friends were very cold.</p>
                     <p>On the 16th day they had a hot diſpute alſo at <hi>Baden:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, them of <hi>Switz</hi> alleadging the National peace formed in 1531; the <hi>Zurickers</hi> called for the Records, and the inſtrument being diſtinctly read, one <hi>Waſer</hi> a Burgomaſter largely declaring, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated that the Popiſh Cantons had never obſerved the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Articles of that peace; but had ſince made all yances againſt them, more accounting of thoſe latter Covenants, than of their Antient general treaties: and that it deſerved no better name then meer Conjuration, and ſworne Conſpiracy againſt them: which they muſt no longer endure; Wherefore <hi>Zurick</hi> ſtanding to their firſt propoſal, required the other Cantons to do juſtice againſt <hi>Switz.</hi> About the ſame time (though all the Popiſh Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons drew in one ſtring) (but ſome of the other Popiſh Deputies pretended an approving of <hi>Zuricks</hi> demands, &amp;c.) the <hi>Zurickers</hi> had intelligence, that <hi>Lucerne</hi> (which was ſaved by <hi>Zurick</hi> from utter ruine in the laſt Rebellion) took notice of the horrible ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders begun, to be ſpread concerning thoſe of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and had publiſhed an Edict, Commanding all their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to abſtaine from thoſe ſlanders on pain of death, alſo they heard, that the Popiſh Deputies offered to let all theſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies be determined, by an equal number of judges, of either Religion; but it was thought by ſome, to be but to gain time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Proteſtants were a great deal more ready for the Field, then the other thought they could be.</p>
                     <p>About January following, it was certified out of <hi>Switzer</hi>-Land into <hi>Engand,</hi> that it clearly appeared, the Pope and his Emiſſaries to have been the inſtruments of raiſing that quarrel among the Cantons: exaſperating his Catholiques, to act ſuch cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties and injuſtice, as had diſſolved the general league of union that was between them: and promiſing ſupplies to carry on that War, which was waging meerly upon the account of Religion: wherefore the Popiſh Cantons endeavoured by Agents to eſtrange the ſcemingly neutral Cantons, from the Poteſtants, and to draw them over to their own party: But the Proteſtants being before them in preparations, and exceeding them in number, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended through the mountainouſneſſe of their Country, to ſtand on the defenſive, ſo to linger out time till ſpring, when as they expected help from their Popiſh friends; but the Proteſtants were then beginning to March with a fair train of Artillery, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke, or, if poſſible, to force the enemy to an open engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time, was ſeen a declaration in <hi>England,</hi> of the judgment of the Miniſters of <hi>Caſsel,</hi> the Court of the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſse,</hi> approving that work of <hi>John Dury,</hi> a Scotiſh Mniſter, who had renewed again his endeavours, for procuring Concord among all of the reformed Religion, who had Caſt off Romiſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition:
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:33388:295"/>wherein among other things, they declared, that as manifold experience had ſhewn, all the Miſeries of War, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils of treachery, Dreadful miſchiefs, by Commotions of States and Kingdoms, do proceed from diſſentions and diviſions in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as out of <hi>Pandora</hi>'s box; ſo from religious and true concord do ſpring all heavenly bleſſings, tranquillity, and all kind of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages: and that, although it had been openly maintained by ſome men, That Agreement in Religion could not be pleaſing to God; yet it was paſt all queſtion, That peace conjoyned with truth, was moſt acceptable to God the Author of both, &amp;c. and as the wiſer ſort anciently held, That the beſt remedy in caſe of Invaſion by a common enemy, was to unite all parties, and take away all enmities and diviſions in the Common-wealth: Why then ſhould it not be thought the moſt adviſeable courſe to take the ſame care in Religious matters, (ſeeing the common enemy, that is, the Pope, became more and more raging every day) that all animoſities and emulations being extinguiſhed, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies and diſputes about matters leſſe neceſſary and weighty being removed, a mutual Concord might be eſtabliſhed by the common conſent of all <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Lutheran</hi> Profeſſours, as very little differing in the main things; leſt their diſſentions ſhould become their enemie's advantage, prejudice to their friends, and open provocations of God's wrath: in order too which, and the like, they ſhewed, That whereas the reſolution of the Eſtates of the Empire convened at <hi>Franckfort</hi> in 1634, might ſerve to point out a way: a Conference at <hi>Leipſick</hi> would be a means to give light in things of truth.</p>
                     <p>The Affairs of <hi>Switzerland</hi> being now in a very broken condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Proteſtant Cantons had three dayes Aſſembly at <hi>Brugg,</hi> unanimouſly reſolving peremptorily to inſiſt, at the next Diett to be held at <hi>Baden,</hi> on the right of Alliance and agreement betwixt all the Cantons: and if reaſon were not done, then to take the field immediately. Which they did; for in the very ſame Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, the Forces ſet out by <hi>Zurick,</hi> (<hi>Werdmuller</hi> being their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral) marched abroad in ſeveral bodies, to the number of 10000 men: <hi>Werdmuller</hi>'s firſt booty was of the plunder of a very rich Cloyſter in <hi>Rynaw,</hi> a ſtrong place and paſſage which he took: then he took in <hi>Keyſerſtuel,</hi> a ſtrong Paſſe upon the <hi>Rhine:</hi> where ſome <hi>Zurickers</hi> were wounded: in the mean time, <hi>Ulrich</hi> the Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General going into <hi>Turgow,</hi> took <hi>Fauchfield</hi> and its Caſtle, with the Popiſh Bayliff and his Officers; but the people preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmitted. After that, <hi>Werdmuller</hi> went toward <hi>Raperſwill;</hi> which place being very well provided, and the bridge ſo defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he made ſome attempts to come near it, and the enemies ſome ſalleys; yet both without effect. But departing thence to the other ſide of the Lake, he took in the Iſland of <hi>Uffnaw,</hi> aſſaulting alſo the very ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Pfeſikan. Berne</hi> being likewiſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to divide towards <hi>Lucerne,</hi> (<hi>Geneva</hi> having ſent them three good Companies of Souldiers) the Cantons of <hi>Friburg</hi> and <hi>Soleure</hi>
                        <pb n="577" facs="tcp:33388:295"/>had endeavoured by their Deputies to keep them therefrom; but they came too late. <hi>Rappeswill</hi> being ſtill beſieged, and they within ſhooting off many chained bullets, flints, and pieces of ſteel, wounding and killing ſome <hi>Zurickers,</hi> they were mightily incenſed: whoſe ſtout reſolution and courage was admired; who although the like cold weather had not been ſeen in that Country for a long time, the horſe and Ordance being ſcarce able to paſſe: yet they would go on (to get as many places as they could) without delay. At <hi>Zurick</hi> alſo came forth a <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> concerning the Subject of that War, whereby might be ſeen the great injuſtice, tyranny, and violence of the Papiſts, and chiefly of the Canton of <hi>Switz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In February following, <hi>Arnaud,</hi> one of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> Doctors before mentioned, was with his opinion, condemned and cenſured by the Moliniſts or Jeſuits, and numerous party of Monks, who had both writton and diſputed in defence of the Doctrine of <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi> (which matter had took up the obſervation and expectations of the whole Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> concerning its event and iſſue) it being put to the queſtion, they damned his Propoſitions; the one as raſh, ſcandalous, and injurious to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: the other, as wicked, blaſphemous and heretical: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſentencing him to be raſed out of the number of Doctors, and degraded from all the functions and priviledges of a Doctor: and further concluding, That for the future, none ſhould proceed Doctour, who did not ſubſcribe to the Cenſure. On the 13th of which February, was the opening of the general Aſſembly of the Clergy of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Proteſtants of <hi>Switzerland</hi> ſucceſsfully proceeding in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the innocent bloud of their maſſacred brethren, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſtrengthened themſelves. Some in that Country were Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral, although Catholiques; <hi>Baſile</hi> alſo being more inclined to peace than war, whoſe Ambaſſadours were then at <hi>Berne:</hi> which <hi>Berners</hi> took <hi>Zug</hi> and beſet it; ſo cauſing great perplexity in the Switz, where, and in divers places, divers Popiſh families (appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the Jeſuits cruelty in egging them on, and preſſing the Magiſtrate to hang, burn, and quarter thoſe that turn to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion) publiquely profeſſed the ſame in the ſtreets, and in great number daily flocked to the Proteſtants, ſubmitting to their protection. <hi>Zurſach</hi> and <hi>Clognaw</hi> did now homage to the <hi>Zurickers</hi> who had aſſured the <hi>Awe:</hi> thoſe of <hi>Genff</hi> 6000 ſtrong, joyning to the <hi>Berners;</hi> who were now 20000 ſtrong, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 3000 more to come unto them out of <hi>Vaud.</hi> There being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe at <hi>Bunthen</hi> 6000 Proteſtants ready to maintain the Paſſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Tyroll</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> The Popiſh Canton Forces of <hi>Uri, Schaye,</hi> and <hi>Underwalden,</hi> kept in a body, where they might have acceſs at pleaſure into <hi>Rappeswill</hi> by the bridge: the beſieged of which Town, very furiouſly ſallying out Jan. 16, with 1000 the choiſeſt men as far as <hi>Warmſpach</hi> Convent, were chaſed in again by the <hi>Zurickers</hi> with great loſſe; <hi>Werdmuller</hi> raiſing the ſpirits of his
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:33388:296"/>men by his valiant example: and Captain <hi>Eldibach,</hi> who kept <hi>Warmſpach,</hi> ſlaying a great number of them. Among them that were taken, were two brothers, held as <hi>Goliahs</hi> among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and being the chief perſecutors of the <hi>Nicodemites:</hi> their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being one who paſſed ſentence on a Widow, one of them that were executed for Religion, (the Proteſtant Deputie's preſence at <hi>Switz,</hi> it ſeems, not ſaving them) and one to whom he owed a great ſumme of money. Another of their moſt valiant Martial men who was ſhot and taken, dyed about three dayes after, raging againſt the <hi>Zurick</hi> Army; who in that engagement had but 10 men ſlain, and 40 wounded.</p>
                     <p>The Deputies of the Neuter Cantons having been at <hi>Zug,</hi> gave their judgment in the Councel of War belonging to the 4 Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, who reſolved to make no agreement, tarrying in <hi>Zurick,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting their anſwer, that they might govern themſelves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: the Deputies of the Proteſtant Cantons meeting at <hi>Araw,</hi> to conſult upon the whole; and the Papiſts at <hi>Mellinguen,</hi> who were not then willing to meet with the Proteſtants. The <hi>Berners</hi> receiving a fall through the imprudence of their Officers, took warning thereby, maintaining all places upon the Lake very well, beſtirring themſelves alſo with a Galley upon it: But the Souldiers of <hi>Ergow</hi> performing their duties very well, ſlew 500 of the enemies: and the <hi>Zurickers</hi> before <hi>Rappenswill</hi> having now gotten near the Town on the Land ſide, ſhooting Cannon at the wall towards the Starr, a great breach was made, the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing made an aſſault, 50 getting into the Town; but the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my retrenching themſelves on the other ſide of the breach, they were beaten back, about 20 being killed, and 20 wounded.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time, an Ambaſſadour of <hi>Savoy</hi> having been at <hi>Araw,</hi> arrived at <hi>Zurick;</hi> where he proteſted, That his Maſter the Duke would never take part with the injuſtices of the Town of <hi>Switz;</hi> (yet himſelf could maſſacre his own Subjects) ſaying alſo, That if the peace were not made, his Maſter would be obliged to ayd his Allies: the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour (who would willingly have quickly ſeen an aſſembly of all the Cautons of <hi>Switzerland</hi>) ſaying juſt ſo. Hereupon, there was a Truce betwixt the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons: which having been prolonged for three dayes more than was at firſt appointed, was to end Febr. 20 after: during which Truce, the Popiſh Cantons (about 3000) invading the Territory of <hi>Zurick,</hi> there acted all manner of cruelties, by burning, Rapes, plunderings, and ſlaying many both old and young: whereof Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Wardmuller</hi> being advertiſed, immediately croſſing the Lake with ſome Troops, and charging them, forced them to retire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Territory of <hi>Switz</hi> and <hi>Zug,</hi> where they preſently falling to commit the like cruelties as before, Colonel <hi>Swyer</hi> (who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Popiſh forces) ſent a Meſſenger to <hi>Wardmuller,</hi> deſiring him to forbear; pretending, what his men had done, was without his order: a thing hardly by the Proteſtants to be believed.</p>
                     <p>Another relation of this matter (for by the time it appears to
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:33388:296"/>be one and the ſame) is thus; Febr. 1. the Generals of the forces of <hi>Switz, Uri, Underwald,</hi> and <hi>Zug,</hi> hearing there would be a Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of arms, (which begun the ſecond of February): as alſo the Conference of the Canton's Deputies at <hi>Baden,</hi> and whither the Deputies of <hi>Zurick</hi> and <hi>Berne</hi> would not come, till the Papiſt and <hi>Italian</hi> Garriſon were thence removed; the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour mainly ſtirring to find out ſome way of accommodation) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved next day (being the ſame Febr. 2.) to fall on the quarters of the <hi>Zurickers</hi> in five ſeveral places, picking out, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, 4000 of their beſt men. The chiefeſt aſſault was made on the ſide of <hi>Ritchtenſchwild Orgen.</hi> The <hi>Zurickers</hi> forlorn guards ſtopt the aſſaulters; but being overpowred by their number, they retired towards the body of the Army, whither the other purſuing them, yet ran away at the firſt diſcharge upon them; and in their retreat plundred ſome ſcattered houſes in the Mountains, burnt a ſmall Village, carried away the Cattle, and practiſed ſeverall great cruelties upon the men, women, and children, cutting off their noſes and privy parts, and after killing them. Another aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault was made on <hi>Wadiſchwill</hi> ſide: the horſe of <hi>Schaff. houſe,</hi> and ſome foot there in garriſon defending the place very well. A third was about <hi>Phirzel,</hi> nigh the river <hi>Sile:</hi> whom Captain <hi>Lochman</hi> ſtoutly reſiſted; but they going about to ſhut him up, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew with his Cannon into a Wood: the enemy there plundring and burning ſome houſes, ſpecially the Miniſter's. The fourth was about <hi>Cappel,</hi> where the enemies were repulſed. The fifth was about the Cloyſter of <hi>Gnadenthall,</hi> which was burnt down by the <hi>Zurickers.</hi> In all which, thoſe of <hi>Zurich</hi> had the beſt, loſing but few men, in compariſon of the aſſaulter's loſſe. The <hi>Zurickers</hi> turned the ſiege of <hi>Rappeswill</hi> onely into a blocking up, which was to be maintained with ſome Regiments: in which Town, he that held <hi>Pavia</hi> againſt the <hi>French</hi> the year before, (with many <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>) was.</p>
                     <p>But the Conference at <hi>Baden,</hi> and Ceſſation of Arms, ended in a peace; ſo that in March following they began to disband for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, put the Counties of <hi>Turgow</hi> and <hi>Baden</hi> again under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Cantons, and to reſtore priſoners: on ſome of whom, the Papiſts had committed ſome unworthy actions: and on the 21 of March, a day of faſting and prayer was kept in <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks</hi> Canton, for a bleſſing on their State: their forces having been all kept in health and union, God having abundantly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed them with Victuals, and preſerved them from ſo many thouſand ſhots before <hi>Rapperswill,</hi> where they loſt but few, and few wounded, notwithſtanding their many skirmiſhes. The <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickers</hi> having alſo but 150 wounded, and 100 ſlain in all that War.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſome Officers and Souldiers were not very well pleaſed at the news of the peace; and the people would willingly have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the War, to have ſuppreſſed the Monks and Prieſts fury; but others thanked God for it, becauſe the Trade began to decay,
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:33388:297"/>and the Merchants to loſe. But the <hi>Zurick</hi> Forces, in all 19000, were in a poſture to be up again at any time, and the <hi>Berners</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have ſome forreign forces ready, that (with their own) they might act more powerfully on all occaſions; for all the Cantons were to meet March 22 at <hi>Baden,</hi> where the Mediatours were to go about the ſettling of the Amneſtie or act of oblivion, and the deciding the grievances both Eccleſiaſtical, Political, and Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical, upon which great debates were expected, there being above 200 Articles to be determined onely about grievances in Religion: upon which, the Monks and Prieſts ('twas thought) would hardly agree; ſo that the Country might be ſet on fire again. But whereas ſome (through wrong information) being much diſpleaſed, ſpread a report, That the two Proteſtant Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons of <hi>Zurick</hi> and <hi>Berne,</hi> had made a moſt diſadvantagious peace with the five Popiſh Cantons, not only prejudicial to themſelves, but to all the Proteſtants and their Cauſe; there was about the ſame time, a publique Monition there ſet forth for better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation therein: declaring, That both the obſtinacy of the papiſts was much abated, and they willing to ſubmit to the Right, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all that was deſired, might be determined without bloudſhed: and alſo, that the Pope was wroth againſt the Proteſtants, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the whole <hi>Italian</hi> Clergy had their purſes open for the Popiſh Cantons: that the Forces of <hi>Italy, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> were marching to their aſſiſtance, and to maſter <hi>Switzerland:</hi> Alſo, that the Emperour had great forces on foot to trouble and undo their Country; which conſidering the ſeaſon of that laſt Winter, he might have eaſily done. And that the Proteſtants were far from any aſſiſtance; which though it might have been procured, yet would have come too late. By all which, every one might judge how the Proteſtant Cantons were neceſſitated to accept of that peace: which notwithſtanding was not (ſaid the Monition) quite decided, but wanted ſomething; and men might believe, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Cantons would not relent, or abate any thing of redreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their grievances, whether Eccleſiaſtical or Political. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, Jan. 30th, 1657, the Arbitrators of the two common or mixt Bayliwicks of <hi>Baſile</hi> and <hi>Appenzel,</hi> where both Religions are profeſſed, gave a deciding Sentence in ſundry heads, both as touching themſelves, and alſo that the charges of the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the other Cantons, ought to be laid on that party who was the cauſe of it; which they judged to be <hi>Switz.</hi> And as for taking of goods, burning of houſes, barns, &amp;c. by either party, theſe (and other ſuch things) ſhould be buried in the Amneſtie or Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>France,</hi> about the beginning of 1656, a little after the peace ratified between that Kingdom and <hi>England,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Narbonne</hi> Preſident of the Clergie's Aſſembly there, went as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, with ſome other Deputies, to the Court; and not finding the King, (for he abſented himſelf) they addreſſing themſelves to the Queen, deſired among other things, that the Proteſtant's pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:33388:297"/>aſſembling-places, built by them ſince the laſt troubles and tumults of <hi>Paris,</hi> might be demoliſhed: Alſo, that they might not be put into Offices and Employments, nor admitted to the governing of Cities and Provinces, nor to Commands in Armies: deſiring moreover, that the King would mind an eſtabliſhing of peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> rather than with <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Sweden.</hi> She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That the King above all things deſired and ſought to maintain peace at home in his Kingdom, and therefore expected that his Subjects of both Religions ſhould live in amity and union one with another; he intending the Proteſtants ſhould enjoy the exerciſe of their Religion in ſuch places as had been allowed them: and that he had no better or faithfuller Subjects and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants than thoſe. And as to <hi>England,</hi> and other Allies of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> the King had done, and would do therein as he ſhould judg moſt convenient, and would adviſe with his Council touching ſuch matters, in due ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>As to the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s Affairs, there having been a Treaty between him and the <hi>Hollandiſh</hi> Ambaſſadours; it was fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and confirmed by ſubſcription at <hi>Elbing,</hi> Sept. 12, 1656, the City of <hi>Dantzick</hi> being ſo far comprehended therein, that they were to agree with the King by themſelves: they not having then reſolved touching the Neutrality upon the Articles that had been propounded unto them.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame moneth and year, the City of <hi>Valentia</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> was ſurrendred up to the <hi>French,</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> the Governour ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulating to have leave to ſend to the Count of <hi>Fuenſaldagne,</hi> That unleſs relief came within two dayes, he muſt ſurrender: and no relief coming, he marched out thence on the 16th day, with 800 horſe and foot, ſix having Vizzards, that they might not be known, who with their baggage and two Cannons, were conducted to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> The taking of that City enabling the <hi>French</hi> to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their Winter-quarters in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> to the great prejudice and indignation of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A little before the ſame time, the <hi>Venetians</hi> took that conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and important Iſle and Fort of <hi>Tenedos,</hi> about the mouth of the <hi>Dardanelles,</hi> from the Turk; who not onely vexing the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Iſland with 26 Ordnance, and 5 Morter-pieces; but alſo firing all their Munitions, and ſpoyling their Wells, they ſurrendred; 800 men, and 300 women, Turks and Grecians, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of it. The Turks being ſet aſhoar upon the Continent, and the Greeks remaining in the Iſland: and through the fear and confuſion which was then great among the Turks, chiefly in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> they doubted not but ſoon to take the Iſle of <hi>Lemnos;</hi> beſides divers other places like to fall into their hands: the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Scio</hi> ſending Deputies at the ſame time to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Forces, inviting them to draw near their Iſland, aſſuring them of an eaſie entrance through the diviſions of the Turkiſh Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders there, who were by their oppreſſions and cruelties become
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:33388:298"/>ſo inſupportable to the Inhabitants, that they alwayes lay in hope of an opportunity of cutting the throats of their oppreſſours.</p>
                     <p>But upon the retiring of the Swediſh and Electoral Armies, the <hi>Poles</hi> getting together, came on again in great numbers, cutting down what ſmaller Swediſh Troops they met with in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And Aug. 24, 1656, <hi>Czarnecki</hi> meeting with 600 Swediſh horſe, and 300 Dragoons, cut them all down; they all dying man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the field. This falling out after ſome overtures for peace had paſſed between the two Kings. Neither were there thoſe wanting (about that time) at <hi>Vienna,</hi> who preſſed the Emperour by all means to afford the <hi>Poliſh</hi> King that aſſiſtance which he had ſo long demanded; but he would not then give ear thereto.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> who entred (as was ſaid before) into <hi>Liefland</hi> with a great Army, having layn ſome time before <hi>Dunenbourg,</hi> took it, and put all the <hi>Swedes</hi> there in garriſon (who were about 2000) to the ſword. Thence encamping before <hi>Riga,</hi> by a ſally out of the City, he was repelled, and retired at ſome diſtance; General <hi>Douglas</hi> being ſent thither with ſhips and ſupplyes. The <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> being in deſpair of taking <hi>Riga,</hi> cauſed him to carry away his greateſt guns the ſooner; which the beſieged perceiving, they ſallyed out Octob. 2d. about 5 in the morning, being 650 men, horſe and foot: and falling on a place called S. <hi>George,</hi> where the enemy was ſtrongly entrenched, they deſtroyed above 1000 of them; taking alſo 17 Colours, and ſome priſoners, among whom was Col. <hi>Sencler,</hi> who through a ſhot received, dyed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after. The night following, he forſook S. <hi>George,</hi> and on the 5th of October, he quitted the ſiege, leaving 17 Iron Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and 16 Lubiſh Gunpowder barrels (which he buried under ground) behind him. And on the 17th of the ſame moneth, a Greek, who was the Keeper of the great Duke's Wardrobe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming over to thoſe of <hi>Riga,</hi> related, that his Maſter was mightily terrified by news brought him, That Field Marſhall <hi>Lowenhaupt</hi> the <hi>Swede</hi> did great miſchief in <hi>Muſcovie,</hi> having defeated two Armies, and taken two Generals of his priſoners. There being alſo a Mutiny in the City of <hi>Moſco,</hi> which forced both the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, and the great Duke's Lady to flee thence, who were arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Polosko</hi> in <hi>White-Ruſsia.</hi> And Novemb. 5th following, there were ſolemn Thankſgivings at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> with diſcharging all their great Guns, for joy of the <hi>Muſcovite's</hi> quitting the ſiege of <hi>Riga,</hi> and the Fortreſſes of <hi>Kakenhowen</hi> and <hi>Notembourg;</hi> of whoſe ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption into <hi>Liefland</hi> there was then no farther appearance, than the viſible remainders in thoſe deſolations and ſpoyls which they had made in the Country. The reaſon likewiſe which induced the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> to that hoſtile attempt againſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be this, becauſe it was concluded in the Treaty made between him and <hi>Poland,</hi> That the <hi>Polanders,</hi> after King <hi>Caſimir</hi>'s deceaſe, ſhould freely chooſe, not onely the ſon of the <hi>Muſcovite;</hi> but himſelf alſo to be next Succeſſour to the Crown.</p>
                     <pb n="583" facs="tcp:33388:298"/>
                     <p>Before the middle of Novemb. the Poliſh Army being in three Bodies, one body of them conſiſting of 30000 <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Tartars, Scewsky</hi> being General, coming to <hi>Pruſsia's</hi> borders near the City <hi>Leik,</hi> ſurpriſed the Electour of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> his Army under the Command of Count <hi>Waldek:</hi> the <hi>Tartars</hi> alſo croſſing the River, came behind them: there was indeed a ſharp fight betwixt them; but the <hi>Pole</hi>'s forces being far greater in number, the Earl was forced to retreat as far as <hi>Angerbourg,</hi> 1500 of his men being cut off, with the loſſe of ſix great Guns, and all their baggage. Yet the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> nothing daunted herewith, ſpeedily collecting his Troops together, went and confirmed the reſt of the <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers,</hi> by uniting them to himſelf; which the enemy perceiving, durſt not come on to proſecute their ſucceſſe, but retreated into <hi>Podlachia.</hi> The Electour himſelf being awakened by this great loſs, (in which Prince <hi>Radzivil</hi> was taken priſoner, M. G. <hi>Ritter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helm,</hi> Col. <hi>Roſe,</hi> Col. <hi>Brunnel,</hi> with other chief Officers, being ſlain,) called upon the Nobility of <hi>Pruſsia</hi> to arm for defence of their Country: who turning their backs, ſaid, They durſt not bear arms againſt the King of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But M. G. <hi>Golts</hi> at the ſame time (arriving at <hi>Tilſe</hi>) fell upon the <hi>Samaytes,</hi> ſtanding in battalia two miles beyond, with very good ſucceſs: who thinking at firſt, that they were all well moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and armed, encouraged his men to ſtand to it: but when he perceived their ſubtilty, that they had no Musquets, but long pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of wood coloured black, except a few who having Muſquets, fired immediately, he ſet on them ſo eagerly, that he got the Victory, ſlaying 1500 of them, and taking as many more priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whereof was <hi>Criſpin</hi> the General himſelf, and 60 other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ones, the reſt being ſcattered and routed. <hi>Criſpin</hi> being brought to <hi>Tilſe,</hi> was to be ſent to <hi>Koningsberg.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> complaining of grievances from the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> King, (who had concluded with the States of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>) having his Reſident at the <hi>Hague</hi> in the ſame Octob. 1656, obtained an anſwer of his buſineſſe; which was, That the States would not be wanting to recommend his Maſter's intereſt to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> that he might receive ſatisfaction touching all the ſaid grievances of which he complained: and that they had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten about the ſame to their Ambaſſadours in <hi>Pruſsia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame year, before this time, even an unheard of miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous invention to deſtroy the lives of people, was practiſed in the Lower <hi>Sileſia;</hi> for ſome buriers of people ſeeing they had but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle work, plotted together, That one of them ſhould (by ſome fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the evil one) learn to make a powder, which he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing, and they throwing in publique aſſembling places, and Fountains, cauſed great infection; ſo that at <hi>Krapis</hi> 2500 dyed thereby. Whereupon the chiefeſt Families withdrawing into the Country; it afterwards chanced, that a hogg of one of the buriers getting out, ran to the Country where the people was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, where being ſhot, the ſaid Burier becoming mad, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:33388:299"/>all his men, that they ſhould die very ſuddenly: who alſo told one that lamented his lately dead Wife, that he wondred at him, ſo to lament, ſince he was within a day to go the ſame way. The Magiſtrate being adviſed of all thoſe; this burier was apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who upon the rack confeſſed his crime and all his Complices, who according to deſert, were put to death with great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>About the moneth November following: the Princes in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> being jealous of each other, every one of them levied Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; for they all feared a new War, which the <hi>French</hi> were like to make againſt the Empire; becauſe there was no ſatisfaction given at <hi>Franckford</hi> for breaking of the peace; for <hi>France</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Empetour did contrary to the Peace made at <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> in ſending Armies into <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> yet the <hi>Germans</hi> ſent into <hi>Italy,</hi> committing great inſolencies there, above what the <hi>French</hi> did, plundring many Monaſteries, and chiefly two, hard by <hi>Milane;</hi> burning down a Village, and plundring the guards of the <hi>Milanois</hi> Governours; not ſparing alſo the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but committing great violences on them, which forced many families to leave their houſes and goods, and to flee from that unlucky ſupply: the affairs of that State could not be then in a worſe condition. And then were the Trained Bands, and ſome new levied Souldiers of the two Electours of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Heydel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> in the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ld, marching one againſt another. Neither of the Princes then yielding to other about the matter of the Cuſtomes; but it was believed that ſome of their Neighbours would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>But the King of <hi>Poland</hi> arrived Nov. 15. at the City of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> with his Chancellor and Vice Chancellour, (being fetcht in by 48 Companies of Citizens) whoſe Army being 30000 ſtrong, (12000 of whom were luſty fighting men) were to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched about that City; who ſoon felt the inconvenience of that numerous Army, to their no ſmall diſcontent, by reaſon of their plundring and ſtealing, ſpoyling and ruinating all the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion Country round about it, which was expected to prove very chargeable to the <hi>Dantzickers,</hi> and breed great and many inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences: they being likely to continue their Quarters under the Cannons of their City, and King <hi>Caſimir</hi> intending to ſtay there himſelf awhile: Parties, in the mean time, of the Poles and <hi>Swedes</hi> every day meeting and skirmiſhing. The Dutch Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours having alſo conferred with the <hi>Poland</hi> King at <hi>Dantzick,</hi> (for both they and the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours were very ſerious and diligent in mediating with him for an accommodation) preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him ſo hard, that they deſired him to nominate a day to begin a Treaty of peace. Who anſwered, He thought it needfull firſt to know whether the Swediſh King would admit of the Emperour and Daniſh King to be Mediatours; otherwiſe all would be to little purpoſe. Next day, thoſe Ambaſſadours addreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Chancellonr of <hi>Poland,</hi> he gave them the like anſwer,
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:33388:299"/>aſſuring them, They ſhould find the King and Eſtates very much inclined to an accommodation; but, he telling them in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, That before any Treaty began, it would be expected, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhould reſtore all places which he held in <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> in the ſame condition as they were before (which was not to be ſo much as propounded to the Swede) both the Ambaſſadour's endeavours, and the <hi>Pole</hi>'s fair ſhews, vaniſhed in an inſtant.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> being very earneſt by his Ambaſſadours, for the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> his aſſiſtance, had propoſed the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Poliſh Crown unto him, (that is, after <hi>Caſimir</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe) which, both the Emperour and his Councel, abſolutely concluded to wave; they finding it then much more convenient and conducible for the Empire, firſt to make ſure of the Crown of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and thoſe hereditarily due unto the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> than to covet after more forreign Crowns. And one of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt Imperial Counſellours being asked his advice alſo, what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was to be returned, he is reported to have anſwered, <hi>Quaerite primo Regnum Romanorum, et caetera adjicientur vobis;</hi> that is, <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdome of the Romans, and others ſhall be added unto you.</hi> Whoſe opinion all the reſt did approve of, and agree unto.</p>
                     <p>On the 29 of October the ſame year, thoſe of the Inquiſition in <hi>Portugal</hi> burnt four perſons alive, who were accuſed and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Judaiſm and Sodomie. And Novemb. 6. following, the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> departing this World, (through obſtruction of the Stone and gravel in his Kidneys) left his Queen, Regent of the Kingdom, during the minority of her ſon <hi>Don Alſonſo</hi> the firſt, who was crowned the 15th of the ſame Novemb. 1656.</p>
                     <p>Novemb. 20th after, in a Treaty between the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> at <hi>Taplaw,</hi> a perpetual League and Confederacy was anew tranſacted and agreed on: to which effect, the Earl of <hi>Slippenback,</hi> and Preſident <hi>Borenclaw</hi> departed from <hi>Koningsberg</hi> with the Inſtrument of that League, to have it ratified by the King.</p>
                     <p>This year 1656, the Plague ſorely afflicted <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo that not onely at <hi>Naples,</hi> but at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Genoa</hi> it raged much: and at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevento,</hi> in Novemb. of 9000 people, there were not above 500 remaining.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Venetians</hi> after <hi>Tenedos,</hi> ſoon took <hi>Stalimene</hi> Iſland alſo from the Turks: and having furniſhed the Fortreſſe there, with all neceſſaries for defence, their Proveditor General ſet ſail with the Fleet towards <hi>Scio</hi> and <hi>Zia,</hi> to refreſh his men: about which time, the Turk caſt away all thoughts of peace with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> having wholly broken the Treaty that had been begun at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> by their Secretary <hi>Bellarini.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> (finding his Souldiers exceeding deſirous to encounter with the <hi>Polanders,</hi> before a greater Froſt came, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them to take their Winter quarters) toward the latter end of November breaking up from <hi>Hone,</hi> he croſſed the River with his Army, conſiſting of 16000 choyſe Souldiers: a little after which,
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:33388:300"/>the <hi>Polonian</hi> Camp under <hi>Lubermiski</hi> was totally defeated before <hi>Cracovia,</hi> which they had beſieged; and the City relieved, which was brought to great extremity.</p>
                     <p>About or in Decemb. following, the once Poliſh Vice-Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour <hi>Radziecouski</hi> was brought (by the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s command) a diſgraced priſoner to <hi>Marienburg</hi> Caſtle, upon the diſcovery of his treacherous carriages to the Swedes: who (ſo ſoon as the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour brake out, that the Swediſh King had forced War upon the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> under his pretence of a better Title, and nearer Succeſſion to the Crown of <hi>Swethland,</hi> and that the ſaid King had paſſed with all his Army in the Baltick Sea, landing in <hi>Pomerania</hi>) addreſſed himſelf unto him, with great promiſe of his fidelity in all actions wherein he ſhould be imployed: and having given at that very inſtant a great teſtimony of the reality of his promiſes, when he had perſwaded <hi>Poſen</hi> and <hi>Caliſsen</hi> to accept of Swediſh protection, the King might in reaſon put no ſmall truſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him: he being a Counſellour in all the principal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and the chief interpreter when the King's occaſion required it. But it was then by his own confeſſion known; Firſt, That he had been the onely cauſe, why the <hi>Coſsacks</hi> (according to their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffers) did never appear with any reality in the Poliſh War, and chiefly againſt the <hi>Muſcovite.</hi> Secondly, That the <hi>Quartians</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Polanders</hi> left the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> at his perſwaſion. Thirdly, That he engaged himſelf to the Jeſuits, that he would then have delivered the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> into their hands. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That he had an intimate correſpondency with the City of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> aſſuring them, that within a little time, he ſhould ſhew himſelf a faithful Son of his Native Country. It was believed alſo, that he had a deſign to betray <hi>Elbing</hi> and <hi>Hoft</hi> into King <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimir</hi>'s hands. But then it was hoped, their Affairs would take another face, and chiefly by the approaching of <hi>Ragotzi</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> at that time: as alſo the conſtant deſire that the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> had for a peace with the Swediſh King; for which cauſe the King intended to ſend one <hi>Coyes</hi> with Inſtructions to make an overture of the ſaid peace. The ſaid <hi>Radziecouski</hi> in or about June following, 1657, was imbarqued at <hi>Elbing</hi> to be tranſported into <hi>Sweden,</hi> there to be impriſoned during his life.</p>
                     <p>A little after, the Chancellour of <hi>Poland</hi> had given the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid anſwer to the Dutch Ambaſſadours: the King of <hi>Poland</hi> and the City of <hi>Dantzick</hi> reſolved, that overtures of peace ſhould be made with <hi>Sweden:</hi> whereupon, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to the Swediſh King, the <hi>Holland</hi> Ambaſſadour being to follow, the King being then at <hi>Marienburg</hi> to receive them, with their Propoſitions from the Poliſh King: although it appears, that Negotiation was to little or no purpoſe,</p>
                     <p>On <hi>May</hi> 18 following, 1657, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> (whoſe Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters was at <hi>Quavicheſt</hi> intended to go to the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer under <hi>Ragotsky</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> (who was now come to his aſſiſtance) upon the tranſaction and agreement made touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:33388:300"/>the evacuation of the Garriſon of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> which was to be ſurrendred to the <hi>Hungarians:</hi> on the 16 day of which moneth, a <hi>Pole</hi> eſcaping from <hi>Samoiſci,</hi> brought Letters, that Marſhal <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenburg</hi> and the other Swediſh Lords there priſoners, were not tranſported from thence, as a rumour was ſpread: he relating alſo, That there was then a great mutiny and diſſention among the <hi>Poles,</hi> divers having torn their Standards in pieces, and run away, yet the Poloniſh Generals kept the reſt together, and were gone with them into <hi>Lithuania.</hi> He likewiſe related, That <hi>Chmielniski,</hi> the <hi>Coſsacks</hi> General, was gone into <hi>Lithuania</hi> with great forces, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king divers Towns by <hi>Arvisko, Arvilef,</hi> and <hi>Bobrosko,</hi> and putting to the ſword all the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> and <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Gentry therein.</p>
                     <p>But the Swediſh Army being joyned with Prince <hi>Ragotzi</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and paſſing the River <hi>Bug</hi> into <hi>Lithuania,</hi> not far from <hi>Krze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mein,</hi> and finding no forces of the enemies, marched towards the ſtrong City called <hi>Bizeſcie Litenky;</hi> who at his approach ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning it with a ſharp commination of total ruine upon not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring, <hi>Zawicky</hi> the Governour anſwered, He intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it to the uttermoſt. The Earl of <hi>Waldek</hi> and Earl <hi>Jacob de la Gardie,</hi> drew near the Town with ſome forces, and ſhot off two pieces of Canon, (the Swediſh ſignal) which paſſing into the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's Lodgings, he, terrified, and forgetting his former reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, next day humbly offered to parley, and yielded on compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: and that, before the King and <hi>Ragotzi</hi> arrived there. So that, that ſtrong and important place was ſubdued without the loſſe of one man, and garriſoned by Prince <hi>Ragotzi,</hi> to whom the King abſolutely reſigned the diſpoſing thereof; although the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged wiſhed to live alwayes under the Swediſh protection: moſt of which Garriſon having been in the ſervice of the King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and Prince <hi>Radzvill,</hi> betaking themſelves again to the King's ſervice: others <hi>Ragotzi</hi> got to his ſide, being raiſed by him: but the Governour and ſome others, with ſome Artillery, were conducted to <hi>Stuzana.</hi> After which, both Armies departed one from another, the King returning whence he came; and the Prince croſſing <hi>Bug,</hi> not far from <hi>Bizeſcie,</hi> where he a while continued.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Poloniſh</hi> and <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Armies under <hi>Lubermiski, Czar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necki,</hi> and <hi>Saphia,</hi> till they were joyned, were chaſed by the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> and the <hi>Tranſylvanians;</hi> ſo that <hi>Czarnecki</hi> ſwimming over <hi>Weyſsel</hi> with 10000 horſe, paſſed into great <hi>Poland,</hi> ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up every where the <hi>Poſpolite</hi> to make a diverſion into <hi>Pomera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> whereof 11 Colours appeared (June 10th) thereabouts on the other ſide of <hi>Thorne</hi> bridge with uſuall bravadoes.

In the mean time, the <hi>Poles</hi> intreating the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> for aſſiſtance out of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> they were flatly denyed, with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, Thut the <hi>Poles</hi> had baſely deceived the great Duke, by

                     <p>On the other hand, Monſieur <hi>Dureel,</hi> the Swediſh Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, having uſed all means to bring the Daniſh King to a fair ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation with the Swediſh, and that proving vain, he left a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> at <hi>Coppenhaguen,</hi> May 13, 1657, containing a ſtate of the differences betwixt them.

                     <p>War being thus begun in good earneſt by the <hi>Danes,</hi> their Camp began to march for the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Bremen,</hi> entring therein in June; in order to which, they went to the <hi>Elbe,</hi> whoſe high waters, and tempeſtuous winds croſſed their tranſportation; yet ſome of their forces paſſing the <hi>Elbe</hi> above <hi>Hamborough,</hi> through the Dominion of <hi>Linnenburg:</hi> in their going over, they gave the other ſigns, burning pitch'd barrels; whereupon 3000 of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Forces were tranſported to the High-land, where they took a Fort, called the <hi>Eaſt-Sconce.</hi>

On the place of fighting, 1500 common Souldiers were ſlain, beſides many eminent ones: the reſt being purſued: many of whom were knockt down by the Peaſants among the buſhes: they took from them 4 Enſigns, 26 Cornets, 5 pair of Kettle Drums, all their Artillery and baggage; <hi>Szaremietow</hi> the General was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoner, being wounded; alſo their Quarter-maſter General, with ſeven eminent Boyars more from <hi>Pleskow,</hi> and many others.

                     <p>About the ſame time, the Emperour being deceaſed, there were differences in <hi>Germany</hi> about the Vicariat or Vice-gerency of the Empire: which having been transferred in the late Wars there, and ſince by the Pacification at <hi>Munſter</hi> ſettled on the Houſe of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> that houſe pretended as if it were a Prerogative inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably annexed and belonging to their Electorate: when as the Golden Bull, the fundamentall Sanction of the Empire plainly confirmed it to the Houſe <hi>Palatine:</hi> which was inveſted and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally poſſeſſed with that dignity, before ever there were Electours conſtituted in the Empire: and which the Golden Bull of <hi>Charls</hi> the 5th did not beſtow on the Electours <hi>Palatine,</hi> but onely far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ratified the ſame unto their Houſe; ſoiemnly declaring to the whole Empire and poſterity, that it did belong unto them, by reaſon of their Hereditary poſſeſſion of the Principality or County Palatine of the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Geſtendorff</hi> Fort being likewiſe ſoon after taken from the <hi>Danes</hi> in <hi>Bremen,</hi> that Dukedome was almoſt freed from them; ſo that in Auguſt, 1657, there was no place (except <hi>Bremerwerden</hi>) which ſtood out againſt the Swedes. Wherefore <hi>Wrangle</hi> leaving behind him a convenient force to ſecure that Country, and carry on the reducement of <hi>Bremerwerden,</hi> he departed thence, to follow the King into <hi>Holſtein,</hi> where the <hi>Swedes</hi> had taken three Sconces from the <hi>Danes,</hi> and ſo got into the Mooriſh Land of <hi>Holſtein;</hi> which
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:33388:303"/>the <hi>Danes</hi> could not free from hoſtile Invaſions. Alſo, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> arriving at <hi>Juiland,</hi> leavying forces for the reinforcement of his Camp; and his Rix-Marſhall <hi>Bille</hi> marching thither to him with 2000 foot from <hi>Gluckſtad,</hi> with other forces brought in from other parts, his Army was look'd on to be very conſiderable; and which, the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Officers were then putting in a poſture fit for battel: And they might expect it, becauſe the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> with the reſt of his Army, advanced after the Prince of <hi>Suliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bach,</hi> whom he had ſent before towards <hi>Jutland</hi> with a ſtrong party.</p>
                     <p>About or in the ſame moneth of Auguſt, the <hi>Venetians</hi> obtained another ſignal Victory againſt the Turkiſh Fleet, at the mouth of the <hi>Dardanelles,</hi> and that in the ſight of the great Turk himſelf, who was ſaid to have come down thither to ſee the fight. But that which ſowred that great Succeſſe unto them, was the loſſe of their General <hi>Moccenigo,</hi> who being in proſecution of the Victory, and afterwards endeavouring to return to the attaquing of the Iſle of <hi>Scio,</hi> a tire of great guns being diſcharged from the Caſtles of the <hi>Dardanelles;</hi> one of them lighted into the Magazine of powder in his own Galley, and blew him (with many more Nobles) up into the Ayr.</p>
                     <p>On the 9th of September following, <hi>Roſenwing,</hi> Envoy from the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> arrived at <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> whoſe buſineſſe was to ſolicite the States for aſſiſtance both by men and money: he rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting alſo, That his King was aſſuredly with his Army reſolving to bid the Swedes battel; but he intended not to engage, till the <hi>Poles</hi> ſhould make their promiſed Invaſion into <hi>Pomerania</hi> to divert the <hi>Swediſh</hi> forces.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of July before, 1657, one Colonel <hi>Doyley</hi> Governour in <hi>Jamaica</hi> Iſland for the Engliſh, wrote into <hi>England,</hi> concerning the good condition the Engliſh were then in.</p>
                     <p>But there having been a difference riſen in <hi>Germany</hi> between the City of <hi>Munſter</hi> and their Biſhop: the Biſhop beſieged that City, (500 Souldiers of the forces levied by the Eccleſiaſticall Electours, going to help their fellow Biſhop in that ſiege; and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had ſent thither 4000 men) but (the Citizens continuing couragious, and reſolving to abide the utmoſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, rather than to ſubmit to ſuch conditions as their Biſhop would have impoſed upon them) it proved a very difficult ſiege; for the beſieged ſallying forth notably, more than once, they ſlew a great number of the Peaſants which came thither to do ſervice. They alſo finding their Governour to be one holding correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the enemy, brought him to Tryall, and put him to death; hanging and quartering four perſons more upon the ſame account, who had undertaken to ſet divers of the chief ſtreets of the City on fire. At length by help of the States General of the United Provinces, (whoſe forces were advancing toward the relief and vindication of the beſieged Citizens) the Biſhop no ſooner heard the news of the ſaid forces advance, but he preſently began
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:33388:303"/>to give ear to the Citizens juſt demands, permitting unto them their ancient Priviledges, rights and immunities. Whereupon they immediately ſuffered him to enter into <hi>Munſter</hi> very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably: the Garriſon being diſpoſed under Gen. <hi>Remona</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he took an Oath of fidelity to the City; (for by a ſure agreement with the Biſhop, the Garriſon was wholly at the Citie's devotion). The Biſhop loſt 1500 men during the ſiege; the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens not above 30, and about 200 wounded. This was in Octob. 1657. After which, the States General's forces retired into their Garriſons from whence they came.</p>
                     <p>But the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> paſſing out of the Dukedome of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> into <hi>Jutland,</hi> (taking upon the way thoſe that were willing into his protection, and dealing with others as he ſaw meet) there was great perplexity among the <hi>Danes,</hi> becauſe of his ſo ſoon coming thither, and arriving at <hi>Alborgh,</hi> which is but 12 or 14 leagues on the other ſide of the Sea from <hi>Gottenburgh</hi> in <hi>Sweden;</hi> this was in Auguſt; about which time, a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Major General having caſt up a Sconce three leagues from the ſaid <hi>Gottenburgh</hi> on an Iſland called <hi>Tiurholmen,</hi> fortifying the ſame with ſome Guns, and inferiour Officers and Souldiers: the Earl <hi>Douglas</hi> juſt then being coming thither, 400 of his Souldiers ſo ſaluted them, that they preſently left the ſame, leaving behind them a great quantity of proviſion. <hi>Douglas</hi> advancing to <hi>Wennersborg,</hi> gathered his Troops together, intending to continue his Expedition in <hi>Norway;</hi> but he was ſtayed there-from by a Letter from Vice-Roy <hi>Brahe,</hi> (out of <hi>Schonen</hi>) then Generaliſſimo by Land and Sea, that he ſhould tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport himſelf into <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> to aſſiſt Duke <hi>Adolph,</hi> and command the Army left there.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> (the while) reinforcing themſelves in <hi>Schonen,</hi> Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals there growing ſcant, the Vice-Roy with his 5000 men was conſtrained to retire to Helmſtadt: the <hi>Danes</hi> paſſing ſafely tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Wood <hi>Hallanſoos</hi> into <hi>Laholm,</hi> gave out, that they were 8 or 9000 men: wherefore <hi>Douglas</hi> received another Order from <hi>Brahe,</hi> to take 1800 horſe, and Col. <hi>Swynehead</hi>'s foot, and to march thither; <hi>Steinbock</hi> alſo having a few dayes before come out of <hi>Pruſsia</hi> to encounter and endeavour to force them back into their own Country. But they having aſſaulted <hi>Laholm</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and being thrice repulſed with the loſſe of 500 men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated again into their Country <hi>Schoneland,</hi> becauſe they heard Earl <hi>Douglas</hi> was to joyn with the Swediſh Army there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Czarneski</hi> with his flying Army going into <hi>Pomerania,</hi> the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was thereby called away out of <hi>Jutland</hi> in haſte; ſo that the Ambaſſadours of the States General of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces going (after a ſumptuous entertainment by the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> in the Caſtle of <hi>Gottorf</hi>) Sept. 13. towards <hi>Flensbourg,</hi> to meet with him,; he was gone ere they were aware: (the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> arriving about the ſame time, from <hi>Jutland,</hi> at <hi>Coppenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi> having left <hi>Fredericks-Ode</hi> and <hi>Fuenen</hi> in a good poſture of defence) but the Swediſh King left his affairs in <hi>Jutland</hi> to be
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:33388:304"/>carried on by <hi>Wrangle;</hi> who commanding his forces there, kept Fredericks-Ode ſtill blockt up by Land: out of which, the <hi>Danes</hi> having made ſeverall ſalleys; on Sept. 20th, they made two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ones with two whole Regiments; but they being repulſed by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> they purſued them till they came under the Canon of the place, killing many, and taking divers priſoners. But the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> having ſent <hi>Wrangle</hi> a Recruit of Foot under Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Ferſens</hi> Command (with an Order to try if poſſible he might carry that Famous and ſtrong Town &amp; Fortreſſe of <hi>Fredericks-Ode,</hi> ſituated on the water towards the <hi>Sound</hi>) of 5000 men, thereby to overthrow the <hi>Danes</hi> deſigne, as alſo to conſider which way he might ſucceſsfully proſecute their expedition into the Iſle <hi>Fuenen,</hi> or give the Enemy a blow ſomewhere elſe; He, on October 23, (having firſt cauſed divers experienced Corporalls, by night to crawle upon their hands and feet, obſerving with all diligence, all particulars needfull to be known about the ſaid place) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Council of War, and propounding the Kings intention, after many diſcourſes of <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> they generally Reſolved to make onſet upon it (the <hi>Danes</hi> then not dreaming of ſuch a thing) in 3 ſeveral places at once in the morning before break of day: which they doing, and all the Officers and Souldiers behaving themſelves with ſingular Courage, it was in a ſhort time, by that one aſſault (although the <hi>Danes</hi> diſputed one Bullwark after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſtout oppoſition, and making the greateſt reſiſtance on thoſe who gave the Onſet on the Gate, in their Poſts toward it) reduced to the Swediſh King's obedience, with the Garriſon, 6 Lieut. Colonels, 8 Majors, 26 Captains, 27 Lievtenants, 26 Enſigns, 2 Engineers, 56 inferiour Officers, 13 Conſtables, &amp;c. being killed and taken; above 2000 common Souldiers were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo taken priſoners, beſides thoſe that eſcaped into the Boggs; and 1100 of the inferiour Officers and common Souldiers ſlain; 33 Colours, with 6 Standards of Dragoons, being likewiſe taken. The Swedes had killed in the action, 1 Adjutant Gen. 1 Capt. of horſe, 1 Corporal, 19 Troopers: and of the foot, 1 Lieut. Col. 4 Capt. 1 Lieutenant, 2 inferiour Officers, 44 common Souldiers, with a great many wounded. Rix Marſhall <hi>Bille</hi> the <hi>Dane</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelf ſo valiantly in that aſſault, that he had divers wounds in his head; but ſeeing all to be loſt, he retreated with the Lord <hi>Hocke,</hi> a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Privy Counſellour, into the little Sconce, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo moſt of the Officers were gone, hoping to get over the water to <hi>Fuenen;</hi> but the contrary wind blowing hard, he was forced to yield himſelf up like the reſt, at diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>After this, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> thinking it expedient and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to undertake a deſign ſuitable to the preſent Neceſſities, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his chief Officers to <hi>Kiel</hi> to confer with them there; himſelf departing from <hi>Wiſmar</hi> in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> Jan. 5. 1657, arriving at <hi>Kiel</hi> on the 9th day: the reſult of whoſe ſerious deliberation with <hi>Wrangle</hi> the Rix Admiral, and others, was, That a tryall ſhould be made to get over into the Iſland of <hi>Fuenen</hi> one way or other,
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:33388:304"/>whether the Froſt held or not. Wherefore the froſt holding, he ſent the Admiral to <hi>Fredericks-Ode,</hi> to order thoſe Regiments in <hi>Jutland</hi> to draw together thither on the 26 day: After the ſending ſome to view the Ice beyond <hi>Fredericks Ode,</hi> and nigh <hi>Fuenen,</hi> and over againſt the Iſland of <hi>Broſoe,</hi> (where the Swediſh ſet foot, for the better performance of their deſign) whoſe horſes of the third party ſent, (the Ice breaking) were drowned, they with much ado ſaving their lives: and after the King's ordering both Wings, and all things accordingly, after ſome diſputes, (this dyſaſter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo happening unto the Swedes, that the two Regiments of <hi>Waldek</hi> and <hi>Koningſmark</hi> ſanck into the Ice; ſo that Col. <hi>Boreman</hi> came to no action: and two Companies of <hi>Waldek's</hi> Regiment were drowned, with ſome Troopers of <hi>Koningſmark</hi> and <hi>Boreman)</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi> were totally routed and put to flight, Col. <hi>Jens,</hi> a valiant and experienced Souldier, deſiring quarter of the Rix-Admiral; thoſe that were not put to the ſword, being immediately taken priſoners: only ſome few retreating upon the Ice, (ſome of whom were drowned) (and of all the <hi>Danes</hi> forces not 200 eſcaping) were purſued at the heels by ſome commanded forces. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon M.

G. <hi>Guldenlew,</hi> who all had fled to <hi>Odenſea:</hi> there were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe taken in divers places, about 60 pieces of Ordnance, with a great quantity of ammunition, and a Magazine well furniſhed: and when the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had ſent the Rix Admiral to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> to ſeize on four Daniſh Men of War there, (a great number of ſmall Veſſels and Boats being likewiſe ſeized on) he preſently came unto <hi>Odenſea.</hi> This Iſland was taken Jan. 30. 1657.</p>
                     <p>But in or about October before, the <hi>Venetians</hi> loſt again the Iſle of <hi>Tenedos</hi> to the Turks, though not without ruine to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet being gone from the ſaid Iſland to take in freſh water; the Turk's Fleet took opportunity to land there a great body of men, who preſently ſetting upon the Fort of <hi>Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi> by ſtorm, were in the firſt attempt repulſed; but they prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for a new Onſet, and being numerous, the <hi>Venetian</hi> Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon working a Mine under the Fort, diſpoſed their powder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with a match fitted to it, and then quitting the place, the Turks taking poſſeſſion thereof, were (Fort and all) blown up into the Ayr. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet returning, and perceiving what had happened, and the Turks Freet being at hand, they prepared for an encounter; which being performed reſolutely on both ſides, (for the Grand Viſier encouraged the Turks, he having come pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:33388:305"/>from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to ſee that Iſland regained, whoſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion is of ſo great concernment to the Commerce of that City) in the concluſion, the <hi>Venetians</hi> got a new notable Victory, ſinking 16 of the Turk's Men of War, with four that came from <hi>Tripoli</hi> to ſerve the Grand Seignior; taking alſo four of their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time, 1500 <hi>Danes</hi> made an Incurſion into <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merwerden,</hi> hoping thereby to have relieved <hi>Bremerwerden;</hi> but the <hi>Swedes</hi> reſolutely playing their parts thereabouts, made good the ſiege, rendring all the <hi>Danes</hi> enterpriſe fruitleſſe, both touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Bremerwerden,</hi> and other places in that Country. <hi>Eggerick</hi> the Governour of <hi>Bremerwerden</hi> keeping in very cloſe, after the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt made upon the <hi>Behlemer</hi> Sconce; from whence they were repelled by the Swediſh Garriſon, with great loſſe.</p>
                     <p>But while the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was thus ſtruggling with the <hi>Dane,</hi> moſt inhumane cruelties and perſecutions were acted by the Papiſts and their party in <hi>Poland,</hi> againſt the Proteſtants: The firſt City which they ſet upon being <hi>Leſna,</hi> whither many Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants had come for ſhelter; there being three Congregations of them, to wit, the <hi>Polonian, Bohemian,</hi> and <hi>German.</hi> They intended to have put all to the ſword therein; but the Citizens having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their coming, left the City and all their wealth behind them, fleeing thorow Woods and boggs into <hi>Sileſia.</hi> The enemy entring the City, found none but aged and bed-rid perſons, whom they barbarouſly ſlew, and after plundring the City, burned it to aſhes. In other places alſo they cruelly murdered divers Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and people of all ages and ſexes.</p>
                     <p>Before the taking of <hi>Fuenen,</hi> the Swediſh King being in <hi>Pomera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> he was intent upon making new leavies to oppoſe the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Poles</hi> under <hi>Czarneski,</hi> who had then removed the War out of <hi>Poland,</hi> to their doors; for 4000 <hi>Poland</hi> Troopers fording the River <hi>Oder,</hi> and plundring <hi>Dowen,</hi> not far from <hi>Stettin,</hi> ſet it on fire. Part of the forces in <hi>Holſtein</hi> being alſo ſent for by the King to oppoſe the <hi>Polanders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> having had a Treaty with the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> it was brought to an iſſue; which was, That he could be no further prevailed with by the King, than to ſtand Neutral betwixt the <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Swedes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About the moneth of December, an Ambaſſadour coming to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> from the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> with a gallant Train, he preſently went to his audience; and at the making of his Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he drew out his Shabel, ſaying, That in caſe the Grand Seignior would not reſtore the leſſer <hi>Babylon,</hi> and make ſatisfaction for the Merchants goods which the Turks robb'd, and the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated <hi>Perſians,</hi> which (during the Treaty of peace) were carried away into ſlavery by his Subjects; then in his King's Name he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared War. There was no anſwer followed hereupon, but both the Ambaſſadour and the chiefeſt of his Train being caſt into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; his head was preſently after ſevered from his body. So that
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:33388:305"/>the Turks being ſure of War with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> there was to be but one Camp ſet out with the Turk's great Enſign, againſt the <hi>Venetian</hi> Republique: The great Prince being to ſtay at home to ſupply recruits, and to have a watchfull eye upon the <hi>Maſcovites,</hi> who then ſpake in Thunder to the Turkiſh Monarchy by their warlique threatenings. Before which time, the ſon of the Grand Viſier being enraged at the death of his father, ſware, He would be revenged on the grand Signior himſelf, and all that counſelled him to put his Father to death. Wherefore he riſing up in rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and making no ſmall diſturbance, ſome adviſed, that he might be endeavoured to be appeaſed by favourable promotions; but others liked not that, becauſe of giving encouragement to others in the like caſe.</p>
                     <p>But the Jeſuits who had been expelled from the City and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of <hi>Venice</hi> the ſpace of 50 years, were re-admitted again by the Senate's authority, upon the Pope's ſolicitation; for which he thanked them by his Nuntio.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Poles</hi> having taken the City of <hi>Conitz</hi> from the Swedes, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> about this time retook it again.</p>
                     <p>In the moneth of January, the Engliſh ſurprized 600 <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Jamaica</hi> Iſland, who had hid themſelves among the Thickets and buſhes, ſome whereof were ſlain, ſome taken priſoners; and ſome other <hi>Spaniards</hi> fleeing away in a ſmall Veſſell towards <hi>Cuba.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About February, <hi>Wrangle</hi> was appointed Protectour of the Dukedome of <hi>Bremen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And about the moneth of April, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> bent his mind above all other affairs, upon the attaquing of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which he intended to ſet upon with an Army in four Bodies. And to this end, the Nobility were preparing to attend him. The grand Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard which uſed to be kept in the City of <hi>Soria,</hi> being brought forth for that Expedition: which was principally undertaken, upon a ſuppoſal (their King being deceaſed) of diſcontents and diviſions in <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But Count <hi>Magnus de la Gardie</hi> (who governed the Province of <hi>Liefland</hi> for the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>) being deſirous to revenge the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> had made the year before into that Country, cauſed 3000 men to be drawn out of the Army there; and entring into the <hi>Muſcovite</hi>'s Country, laid near 100 Villages in aſhes, put 2000 men to the ſword, took <hi>Beſur,</hi> a place betwixt <hi>Dorpt</hi> and <hi>Plotzko,</hi> which was the place of the Magazine for Arms and Ammunition, and ſet fire on the Town. Whereupon the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> being provoked, a body of them purſued the Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh as they were returning with their booty, which being re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by an addition of 2000 <hi>Germans,</hi> it came to an Encounter; but the Swedes being ſtrengthened by ſome forces, ſent them by the Governour of <hi>Revell,</hi> got the better, forcing the enemy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in diſorder, leaving 600 men dead on the place, and 400 taken priſoners.

                     <p>But that which in Octob. 1657, made things run to an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in <hi>Portugal,</hi> was the exceſſive Demands of the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the United Provinces, by their Commiſſioners, from that Kingdom: who in their Treaty at <hi>Lisbone,</hi> (demanding poſſeſſion of the Realm of <hi>Angola,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>S.

                     <p>But <hi>Czarneski</hi> with 8000 Poliſh horſe entring in the ſame Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber into <hi>Pomerania,</hi> waſted that part of it which belonged to the Swede; and advancing as far as betwixt <hi>Stetin</hi> and <hi>Anklam,</hi> they dealt moſt barbarouſly with the Inhabitants: yea they came to <hi>Anklam</hi> it ſelf, where they burnt the Horſe-Mills, (alſo a ſecond time before <hi>Stettin,</hi> conſuming and burning down all to the ground thereabouts) and had not the overflowing of the River <hi>Pein</hi> hindred, they would have made a farther ſpoyl and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe; whereupon they returned back again into the <hi>Marck:</hi> and the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> being then thereabouts, collecting his forces to oppoſe them; (his men being mightily encouraged by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected news of the taking <hi>Fredericks Ode</hi>) they hearing the King was drawing an Army together, went back again over the <hi>Oder. Czarneski</hi> afterwards returning into <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About November, the <hi>Portugal</hi> Forces having rendezvouzed at <hi>Elvas,</hi> not onely paſſed the River of <hi>Guadiana;</hi> but coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moron,</hi> after four dayes ſiege, conſtrained the Governour to ſurrender it upon Capitulation: which news moved the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in regard it was provided with all neceſſaries for a long ſiege, and might have held out, till relief had been brought by the Duke of <hi>San Germano,</hi> the Spaniſh General.</p>
                     <p>But at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> all means was uſed to intercede for the <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks,</hi> that they might be reconciled to the Crown of <hi>Poland;</hi> where likewiſe warlique preparations both for Sea and Land were then eagerly followed. Then were the <hi>Perſians</hi> alſo ſtirring againſt the Turks; whoſe Land-forces were to act againſt them; (if they could not either make a ceſſation of arms with them, or find out ſome other way for accommodation, which they deſired) wherefore they then blockt up <hi>Lemnos,</hi> which being reduced, their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces might be employed either againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> or ſome other parts. But the <hi>Venetian</hi> Commander in <hi>Lemnos</hi> ſtoutly behaving himſelf, repulſed the Turks in 15 aſſaults: yet the Turks at laſt taking the ſaid Iſland of <hi>Stalimene</hi> or <hi>Lemnos,</hi> ſent thither a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of 10000 men.</p>

                     <p>A little after which, the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Court at <hi>Vienna</hi> reſolved to proclaim the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> for an open enemy, and to publiſh open war againſt him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Philip</hi> the 4th King of <hi>Spain</hi> being aged, and almoſt beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, having a young Prince, his Son and Heir, born unto him in November, 1657, Bonefires were cauſed to be made throughout all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions: all Officers being to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that ſolemnity in the moſt magnificent manner.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Poles</hi> continuing their Leaguer before <hi>Riga,</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Helmfield,</hi> Jan. 12. 1657, aſſaulted the beſieger's well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Leaguer with about 6000 men on the other ſide of the <hi>Duna;</hi> and ſucceſsfully ſcaling it, he took 20 Colours, with all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery and baggage, and 200 priſoners; among whom were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Poliſh Lords, and perſons of note; Col. <hi>Wigand</hi> their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander was ſlain, with divers other Colonels, and 1800 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers alſo killed on the place. The Conquerours finding ſuch ſtore of proviſions and victuals there, that the Inhabitants of the City were two dayes in carrying of it away; ſo that the <hi>Pole</hi>'s Leaguer was wholly ruined, and thoſe of <hi>Riga</hi> ſet free again.</p>
                     <p>In or about February after, the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> and <hi>Poles</hi> going up further into the Country of <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> committed great outrages and inſolencies in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Ermland.</hi> They ſeized on <hi>Newark</hi> by treachery of a Popiſh Burgomaſter; and afterwards the Caſtle <hi>Brazian.</hi> But thoſe of <hi>Thoren</hi> having a deſign, ſallyed out upon the <hi>Poles,</hi> killing many, and taking a number of priſoners, with 4 field-pieces, and much Ammunition.</p>
                     <p>A little before which time, all the people of <hi>Naples</hi> being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, as not liking the Spaniſh Government, 8000 Bandits were on foot in that Kingdom, their Leaders being of great Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: ſo that, the Tower of <hi>Annunciado</hi> was ſaid to be taken, and three garriſons put to the ſword. But the Vice-Roy took two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops which were among the Bandits, as alſo a man diſguiſed in womans cloaths, who privately carrying a Poniard to ſtab the ſaid Vice-Roy, intended thereupon to have raiſed a Tumult. And theſe Bandits continuing their rebellion, one Capt. <hi>Martelli</hi> about Jan. meeting with a party of them, purſued and took 20 of them, cutting off their heads; the reſt taking Sanctuary in a houſe at <hi>Pazano,</hi> long defended themſelves: but at length they being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to yield, were ſent priſoners to <hi>Baia</hi> Caſtle. After which, the Vice-Roy ſent a Body of forces toward <hi>Salerne</hi> and <hi>La Poville,</hi> to endeavour the hindering of the ſaid Bandits from encreaſing their Troops that way; for they were grown very inſolent and audacious, being encouraged by hopes of ſuccour the next Spring out of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Swedes having taken not onely <hi>Fuenen,</hi> but <hi>Langland, Laland, Phalſter,</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> from the <hi>Danes;</hi> inſomuch, that their forces were every where defeated and reduced under the Swediſh power; the two Kings came unto a Treaty of Peace; in
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:33388:307"/>which, Engliſh Agents (the Daniſh King having accepted of the Protectour's mediation) and French, with ſome Plenipotentiaries of the Daniſh Rix-Senatours, (all others being excluded) were to mediate. But the Daniſh King being reduced to a deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the agreement was made by the mediation of an Engliſh Envoy, whom the ſaid King prevailed with to interpoſe: the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> giving but 24 hours parley; and it was done, upon very advantagious conditions on the Swediſh King's ſide; as alſo ſomewhat for his Father in law, the Duke of <hi>Holſtein.</hi> This Peace was concluded betwixt them, on Febr. 27. 1657.</p>
                     <p>On Febr. 20th, there began a Poliſh Convocation in <hi>Warſovia,</hi> where many Senators appeared. A main Propoſition there made, being concerning a Treaty of Peace with <hi>Sweden;</hi> which if it could not be obtained, then means was to be reſolved on for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the War, and to make a League with the United Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therland Provinces; and an agreement with the <hi>Coſsacks,</hi> for a ceſſation of Arms. The Senators then took an Oath, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal any of their Conſultations. The Gentry likewiſe complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned much againſt the quartering of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> forces, and the maintaining of their own Souldiers: for whom moneys were to be raiſed. There was alſo another Propoſition concerning the toleration of the Proteſtant Religion; which the Gentry admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (though the Clergy accepted not of it) declaring, That the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and Reformed Religion ſhould be tolerated, but not the Socinian. They alſo reſolved againſt the Clergies Proteſtation, which would have no peace with <hi>Sweden,</hi> accepting of the <hi>French</hi> mediation therein. Then alſo the Commander of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> forces defiring an Oath of fidelity to be made to him in the King of <hi>Hungary</hi>'s name, in the City of <hi>Cracow,</hi> the States of <hi>Poland</hi> were much offended.</p>
                     <p>There was likewiſe about this time, a meeting of the Clergy in <hi>Flunders,</hi> to raiſe money for the King of Spain: The Biſhop ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them, ſaid, There was great neceſſity, that a ſum ſhould be yearly raiſed to proſecute the War againſt the Engliſh and French; alledging, that the Enemies aymed chiefly at the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie's revenues; they being then upon the hazard of loſing all: all which might be prevented. Their Aſſembly brake up divers times: at whoſe firſt meeting, many of them declared, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poor, had nothing to give; which being known to the contrary, they afterward contributed, and ſubſcribed large ſums.</p>
                     <p>But ſomething not altogether inconſiderable, comes to be rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> the ſtate of the great <hi>Mogol;</hi> who there deceaſing, in 1657, the <hi>Indians</hi> loſt ſuch a pretious treaſure in him that was ſo wiſe and fortunate, that they deſpaired of ever ſeeing a Succeſſour to his Virtues; yet he lived to the age of 73 years: who leaving behind him four ſons, (and being by every one a grandfather) they were all ſomewhat equally ballanced in power, (by a diviſion of that vaſte Empire, into a kind of Tetrar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy)
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:33388:307"/>being onely ſubord inate to their father while he lived: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the right of primogeniture extend the eldeſt his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions any farther, than by the ſword, which was then like to be the Arbitrator: ſo that whatever was done by the three Elder brothers, the diſtance of the place, and difficulty of paſſage had then denyed intelligence to thoſe of <hi>Surrat:</hi> but <hi>Morat Bux,</hi> the younger, having crowned himſelf king of <hi>Guzarat,</hi> his Seat being at <hi>Abmadwad,</hi> (a great City 100 miles from <hi>Surrat</hi>) ſent in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or about the beginning of Novemb. 1657, an Army under an Eunuch's command to reduce <hi>Surrat</hi> Caſtle, it being of very conſiderable ſtrength, and commanding the beſt Port of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, beſides a treaſure of above 200000 l. ſterling therein; but the Governour refuſing to deliver it to any but <hi>Dorroskokore</hi> the Eldeſt, who was King of <hi>Delly,</hi> the Eunuch cloſe beſieging the ſame, and working three Mines under the brink of the Meat, he ſprang one of them, Decemb. 20, blowing up 60 yards of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wall; which although it would have little advantaged him, (had the Souldiers continued reſolute) yet the frights of danger, and promiſed indempnity, made them conſtrain the ſaid Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſurrender it, Decemb. the 4th after, (though on honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable terms, and after much loſſe to the beſiegers) That diviſion having almoſt put an end to the Trade of <hi>Surrat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About the latter end of 1657, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> remaining about <hi>Jemma,</hi> which they had beſieged from the middle of Febr. before, with between 5 and 6000 men; M. G. <hi>Horn,</hi> Governour of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>germanland,</hi> approaching with but 800 men, and four pieces of Cannon, took from them the Fort of <hi>Kakelwerck,</hi> putting 100 <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> to the ſword therein: whereupon, the main body drawing off from before <hi>Jemma,</hi> he had opportunity to put Ammunition, Victuals, and freſh men into that Town, without any oppoſition of the enemy.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Coſsacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> about the ſame time made an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Peace alſo between the Houſes of <hi>Ottoman</hi> and <hi>Auſtria</hi> was confirmed: and it was hoped the <hi>Coſsacks</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> would agree alſo. And likewiſe that a Peace would be made between <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Sweden:</hi> For the Treaty in order to a compoſure went on in April, 1658, betwixt their Commiſſioners; the ſucceſſe of a fair concluſion being very probable: which thing not a little alarmed the great Duke of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> who was very active to proſecute his deſign, fearing thoſe two Kings reconciliation might prove pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to him; who ſent an Expreſſe to the Poliſh King, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand an execution of the Treaty heretofore made at <hi>Vilna</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, particularly that point reſpecting the <hi>Muſcovite</hi>'s el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſon's ſucceſſion to the Crown of <hi>Poland:</hi> whereby the Poliſh king apprehending, that the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> did but ſeek a pretext for War, he therefore ordered one part of his forces to obſerve the motion of the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Czarneski,</hi> (who was then made <hi>Cracovian</hi> Palatine in the room of <hi>Miskowsky</hi> deceaſed) was to have his Rendezvouz Apr. 20,

                     <p>On the 19th day of which moneth, the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Newburgh</hi> was delivered of a young Prince, which made the Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</p>

                     <p>But in the ſame moneth of April, 1658, 800 foot Souldiers out of Poloniſh Regiments paſſing over the River Weyſsel about <hi>Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw,</hi> with intent to take poſt in a Sconce not far from the Village <hi>Liſsaw,</hi> and ſo to invade the great Werder: Prince <hi>Adolph</hi> ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning all the horſe and foot to be had in <hi>Elbing</hi> and <hi>Hooft,</hi> would forthwith have encountred them: But the Bridg being ſomewhat damnified by the high water, he was hindered; ſo that the enemy had time to fortifie themſelves with ſome Paliſadoes: but as ſoon as the Swediſh got over, they advanced before the ſaid Sconce of <hi>Liſsaw,</hi> which the Poliſh (though they made ſtrong oppoſition, after L.

                     <p>
                        <hi>May</hi> 4th after, 1658, the French, with ſome Engliſh aſſiſting them, had a defeat in attempting to ſurprize <hi>Oſtend</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> by a Plot laid with two Burgomaſters, and ſome others within the Town, one <hi>Spindeler,</hi> a Colonel, baniſhed formerly out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> being to be a chief actor in the buſineſſe, who was indeed their betrayer.

                     <p>But about the middle of July, the Swediſh forces invading Electoral Pruſſia, and plundring ſome Villages, they killed the Duke of <hi>Brandendurg</hi> his ſafe-guards which they there found, but one Col. <hi>Shoneck</hi> lying in wait for them, met at laſt with a Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh party of 200, near <hi>Roſenberg,</hi> bringing ſome of them priſoners to <hi>Kingsberg.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then alſo the Treaty betwixt <hi>Sweden</hi> and the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully going on, the Governour of <hi>Riga</hi> wrote to the Swediſh king, That he hoped there would be no occaſion to ſend force againſt him. But the Cham of <hi>Tartary</hi> ſent to the king of <hi>Poland,</hi> and congratulating him, proffered him aſſiſtance againſt all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>This preſent year alſo, 1658, came intelligence into <hi>England,</hi> of the great ſucceſſe which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> forces had in <hi>Jamaica</hi> Iſland againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> landing there; as alſo, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Plate-Galleons which were bound from <hi>Carthagena</hi> for <hi>Spain,</hi> were caſt away by a Hirrecane; the <hi>Bermudans</hi> bringing into <hi>Jamaica</hi>

                     <p>But Prince <hi>Ragotsky</hi> being returned out of <hi>Poland</hi> into <hi>Tranſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> the Great Turk (having before commanded him in 1657, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on great penalty, not to proceed in his march againſt <hi>Poland</hi>) ſent to him, to reſign his Principality of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> to his Couſen <hi>Reada;</hi> he at that preſent yielded thereto; (although to reſign up any of his Forts into the Turks hands, he utterly denyed) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſuming his Principality again, without the ſaid Turk's conſent, he being enraged againſt him, would try his utmoſt to deveſt him; and diſpoſſeſs alſo the Princes of <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Wallachia:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he ordering great forces againſt him, about the latter end of April, 1658, the Turks totally defeated the Prince of <hi>Wallachia,</hi> who was marching to Prince <hi>Ragotzi</hi>'s ayd, (who had alſo ſent to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to demand the promiſed ayd by the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> againſt thoſe Turks) 8000 being ſlain upon the place, and a great number of priſoners taken; among whom, were dives Boyars, the principal Officers of that Prince: who thereupon fleeing into <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> the Turks forced another to accept his Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And the Grand Signior being ſtill bent to dethrone the ſaid <hi>Ragotzi,</hi> ſent about July rigorous Orders to the <hi>Moldavian</hi> and <hi>Wallachian</hi> Princes, That they ſhould endeavour to invade him. But to the Baſhaw of <hi>Buda,</hi> he ſent more ſevere order for the ſame effect, with a threatning, That if he did not his duty, he ſhould be flead alive, and his skin placed on one of <hi>Buda</hi>'s Towers. Wherefore the Baſhaw advancing about the beginning of July, Prince <hi>Ragotski</hi> challenged him to a fight: who thereupon break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up from <hi>Lippa,</hi> and marching towards <hi>Arad</hi> Caſtle, the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvanians</hi> fired the Suburbs near that Caſtle. The Turk's Officers who led the Avant, ſeeing the ſmoke and fire, haſtened directly to the Caſtle, whom the <hi>Hungarians</hi> following, put them to flight, taking and putting many to the ſword; <hi>Muſtapha Beg</hi> being taken priſoner. Wherefore the <hi>Tranſylvanians</hi> encouraged, drew near the Turks main Army; the Turks thereupon diſcharged 3 great Guns as a warning, that their men ſhould retire within the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons placed ſo as to ſerve for a ſafeguard: but the Tranſylvanians ſo roundly plyed them with their great Guns, that they being brought into confuſion, fled into a Valley: whom the Tranſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians purſuing, drave them into the River <hi>Mor,</hi> where they were drowned: and the whole Turkiſh Army became a prey: this was on July 4th, 1658. The chief priſoners being beſides <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> wounded, the Baſſa of <hi>Agria,</hi> the Col. <hi>Aga</hi> of the Janizaries, Col. <hi>Gyenely Aga</hi> at Buda, and the Beg of Lippa: <hi>Alai</hi> Beg of Waitzen being trodden to death by the horſe; the Baſhaw was likewiſe ſo put to it in the flight, that he was forced to run into the water: whom notwithſtanding, a <hi>Huſsar</hi> purſued, catching him by the garment to take him; but he was reſcued, and the <hi>Huſsar</hi> ſlain. The Prince's men purſuing them above 30 leagues to one of their chief Cities, they returned with rich booties. The news of this rout cauſed ſuch an alteration at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:33388:310"/>(violating the Law of Nations, and growing in a rage againſt the Chriſtians) they impriſoned the Imperiall and French Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, charging the French of being complice with his Son in his Letter in Cyphers, which they intercepted: and the other, That his Maſter had ſuffered ſome <hi>German</hi> Companies to ſerve under <hi>Ragotski,</hi> (although the Emperour's Deputies had demonſtrated, it was without his conſent; and that the Turk for his money might have as many of them as he would).</p>
                     <p>In Auguſt following, the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> forces being apprehended to be on their march towards the Frontiers of the Turks, to oppoſe their power, it was wiſhed, they might deal better with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in thoſe parts, than the forces under the Count of <hi>Dhona</hi> had done, who uſed them no otherwiſe, than the Turks were uſed when over-powred.</p>
                     <p>But the Portugal having this Summer taken the field againſt the Spaniard, about <hi>Elvas,</hi> they beſieged and took the Fort of St. <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> before <hi>Badaiox,</hi> and paſſing the River <hi>Guadiana,</hi> their General June 22, aſſaulted another very ſtrong Fort which the Spaniards had builded: and ordering the General of horſe to get between the Fort and City to demoliſh the Spaniards lines, he put to the ſword two Troops of horſe, and two Companies of foot, whom they had left behind, except two taken. There was 400 well armed in the Fort with an Iriſh Commander, who coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly behaving themſelves, and the enemy coming (the mean time) out of the Town to hinder their deſign, 300 appointed againſt the Portugals right Wing, were every man killed on the place; and the like happening to them that were commanded for the left: thus after three hours they were totally defeated and driven back, leaving 1200 on the place. Whereupon the Fort was ſurrendred at the Portugals mercy; the Iriſh being permitted onely to come forth with ſwords; but all the Spaniards without arms. The Portugals loſſe being of no conſequence; onely ſome Commanders wounded, among whom was the Duke of <hi>Cadaval.</hi> After this, the Spaniard forſook another great Fort made on the River, leaving all in it behind them; which theſe taking, ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly garriſoned them both; and advancing to Badaiox, they wholly beſieged it.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> in or about the ſame Auguſt, embarquing 4000 horſe, and 6000 foot, was found in that deſign to return again upon <hi>Denmark:</hi> The reaſon whereof was variouſly cenſured; ſome being induced to believe, That ſome under-hand provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been given to that magnanimous King by ſome in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark;</hi> for he landing at <hi>Corſoer</hi> a Port of <hi>Zealand,</hi> marched direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards <hi>Coppenhagen;</hi> and meeting (by the way) ſome Daniſh horſe, they were content to ſerve under him: who was generally believed to take that opportunity to do himſelf right, and enſure all behind him; that he might ſafely return into <hi>Pruſsia</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merania</hi> againſt the <hi>Poles</hi> and other his enemies. But ſince this his invaſion of <hi>Denmark,</hi> many ſtately Houſes and Farms were ſeen
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:33388:310"/>on fire as well towards <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> as the <hi>Sound.</hi> The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> being at <hi>Ringſtead,</hi> the Daniſh King ſent two Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours from <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> about or on Aug. 10th, to demand the reaſon of that ſudden alteration, who being admitted to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he with ſuch grounded reaſons demonſtrated unto them the cauſe of that his action, that they could not anſwer a word againſt it, but returned back with tears in their eyes. On the 11th day, the King advancing about half a league from <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> from the hill on the left hand, they perceived the Daniſh reſolved to ſtand upon their defence, having ſet all the Suburbs on fire. The King approaching the City, Aug. 13, ſaluted the ſame with two pieces of Cannon; which being anſwered out of the Town with three, they fired without intermiſſion, to hinder their begun ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; who had taken the Hoſpital on one ſide; ſalleys being made without any great damage to either. <hi>Cronenburgh</hi> Caſtle being likewiſe beleagured with three Regiments under Admiral Count <hi>Wrangle.</hi> The Danes alſo deſigning to fire <hi>Helſenor,</hi> ſome Swediſh horſe being ſent to defend it, hindered the ſame. And Sept. 7. 1658, <hi>Cronenburgh</hi> Caſtle was ſurrendred to the Swediſh King, with a gallant.

                     <p>But the great Prince of Turkey proffering to the Cham of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, Tranſylvania,</hi> if he could win it, he reſolved to that end to joyn his forces with the Turks; but <hi>Wyhofsky</hi> General of the Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks, requeſting him to ayd him againſt the Coſſacks ſiding with the Muſcovites; he ordered <hi>Kaarath Beg</hi> his Kinſman to march to <hi>Ukrain</hi> with 20000 Tartars: with whom <hi>Wyhofsky</hi> joyning with 20000 Coſſacks, they ſhould go againſt thoſe in the Muſcovite's ſervice. But being come over <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> the Coſſacks under the Muſcovites ſent them Commiſſioners, perſwading them that through great ſcantneſſe of proviſion and forrage, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſeparate from the Tartars, and to encamp themſelves apart: they diſſemblingly treating with the Tartars; theſe two parties of Coſſacks uniting, fell on the Tartars Camp, ſlaying 15000 of them, among whom <hi>Kaarath Beg</hi> was one. And then invading <hi>Nahaiiſh Tartary,</hi> they made all havock they could, and were like ſo to proceed. Thus the Coſſacks (againſt the <hi>Polanders</hi> and <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hofsky's</hi> will) became open enemies to the Tartars; which is not eaſie to be reconciled with <hi>Poland</hi> and its confederates. Neither could the Tartars be taken for truſty friends to Poland, becauſe they ſtrove, or are ſtill ſtriving, to make peace with the Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, whoſe Duke is an Arch-enemy to the Tartars.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Flanders</hi> the Spaniſh Army received a rout Sept. 3. 1658;
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:33388:311"/>for a body of Spaniards (betwixt 4 and 5000 men) under the Prince of <hi>Ligne</hi> marching to joyn with their other forces, thought to have viſited <hi>Ypre</hi> by the way, and to put ſuccour therein; but they being engaged by the French, were wholly routed, the Prince of <hi>Ligne</hi> having his arm ſhot off, 1200 being taken priſoners, the reſt ſlain and put to flight. <hi>Oudenard</hi> and <hi>Meenen</hi> was likewiſe about this time taken from the Spaniard, and <hi>Armentiers</hi> likewiſe cloſely begirt. But on the 26 day of the ſaid Septemb the Town of <hi>Ypre</hi> was delivered into the poſſeſſion of Marſhal <hi>Turein:</hi> the Spaniards marching forth in the morning, about 7 or 800 men, with their Arms, Baggage, and two pieces of Cannon, with three Princes, beſides the Governour. That City being one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and faireſt of <hi>Flanders,</hi> was quickly carried, by the valiant and reſolute Onſets which the Engliſh forces made upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarps, and other Out-works; ſhewing the like Courage there, as they had done before at ſeveral other Towns.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Brandenburgiſh, Auſtrian,</hi> and <hi>Polonian</hi> forces toward the latter end of this laſt September, were drawing near the Swediſh forces in <hi>Holſtein;</hi> having then already encountred with ſome Swediſh parties: the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> going to <hi>Tonningen,</hi> where the Swedes were drawing into a body. Of the Enemies, <hi>Spork</hi> led the Avant, conſiſting of 3000 Auſtrian horſe; the Brandenburgiſh forces being 10000 horſe, and 200 Dragoons; <hi>Czarneski</hi> being with the Poliſh foot, and 6000 horſe commanded by the two Fieldmarſhalls, who marched with the Artillery, marching very ſlowly by reaſon of the bad wayes: this Army was thus marching in the beginning of this preſent moneth Octob. 1658: the Elector of Brandenburg having publiſhed a <hi>Manifeſto, aſsuring</hi> the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> That his Souldiers ſhould not be troubled in their houſes, nor be damnified by them, deſiring onely their Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, whereby the Souldiers might have ſome accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, on the 4th of this preſent October, came an Account from Col. <hi>Doyley</hi> Governour of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> of the proſperous ſucceſſe of the Engliſh againſt the Spaniards there, who being 30 Foot-Companies landed at <hi>Rio Nova,</hi> a place in the North of that Iſland: and being 12 dayes there before they were diſcovered, the ſaid Governour ſetting ſayl with 750 Officers and Souldiers, after a valorous landing, June 22, he ſummoned the Fort; but the Governour <hi>Don Arnoldo &amp; Saſi</hi> ſending a confident denyall, the Engliſh, next morning, marching toward the Fort, and climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up an high Hill, advanced in ſight of the ſaid <hi>Rio Nova</hi> Fort: where finding the Work on the Land ſide not finiſhed to that heighth, as to the Sea-ward, they receiving their ſhot, ran up the Flankers with their forlorn, having hand-Granadoes, and gained it in a quarter of an hour; many of the Spaniards running out of the Works, the Engliſh followed the chaſe about 3 or 4 miles, doing execution: the Sea-men alſo ſeeing them run along the rocks, coming out with their boats, killed many: ſo that above
<pb facs="tcp:33388:311"/>300 perſons were ſlain, divers Captains, two Prieſts, and their Serjeant Major: about 100 ordinary priſoners being taken, and 6 Captains, whom they ſent home, the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Standard, and 10 Colours: the reſt, eſpecially the ſtrangers in the Woods, being liable to periſh. In that Fort was taken 10 barrels of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, great ſtore of ſhot, 6 pieces of Ordnance, and great ſtore of proviſions.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ancient Geographers; and Poets, Orators, and Hiſtorians (who learned the parts of the World's ſituation from them) have deſcribed onely thoſe Lands which they knew, and which they judged habitable. We profeſſe, that many places were to them unknown: and thoſe which they believed were forſaken either through heat or cold, we know are inhabited in many places. There are ſix general Parts of the World: the <hi>Arctique</hi> or North; <hi>Antarctique</hi> or South; <hi>Europe, Africa, Aſia,</hi> called the old parts, becauſe they were known to the Antients, and <hi>America,</hi> (comprehending under it <hi>Magellanica</hi>) called the New World, becauſe newly diſcovered within this two hundred years.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Arctique</hi> belong, 1. The Countrey under the North Pole, unknown. 2. <hi>Greenland,</hi> which lying at 80 degrees of Latitude, bears graſſe and green herbs, from whence alſo it took its name. 3. <hi>Newland.</hi> 4. <hi>Iceland,</hi> which is now ſubject to the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> 5. <hi>Nova Zemla,</hi> (which though it be four de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees more Southerly than <hi>Greenland;</hi> yet it is altogether naked, and without paſture, an Iſland ſtinking with fleſh-devouring beaſts) with the <hi>Hyperborean</hi> Sea, and two Narrow Seas. <hi>Waygaz</hi> and <hi>Davis,</hi> whereof the one is more Eaſterly, the other bending more to the Weſt.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Antarctique</hi> are to be referred thoſe vaſt Countries, which lying under the South Pole, are longly and largely extended through the cold, temperate, and torrid Zone: where not onely
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33388:337"/>
                     <hi>Peter Ferdinand</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> preached; but alſo are commendable for the conſtitution of the Ayre and ſoyl, and largeneſſe of the Countries; equalizing <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> taken both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>But the diſpoſure and order of the other four parts is on this wiſe; <hi>Aſia</hi> is to the Eaſt, to which <hi>Africa</hi> is joyned from the South, and partly alſo to the Weſt. <hi>Europe</hi> is joyned to <hi>Aſia</hi> from the Weſt and North. <hi>America,</hi> a little farther toward the Weſt; and laſtly, <hi>Magellanica,</hi> directly toward the South. In all parts of the World are to be conſidered, firſt, their bounds towards the climates, and ſo a diſtinction from other neighbouring parts; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, their chief accidents: And laſtly, their natural portions, to wit, the chief Mountains, Seas and Rivers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>EUROPE</hi> (which is thought to have taken its name from <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> a <hi>Tyrian;</hi> whom ſome make the daughter of <hi>Agenor;</hi> others of <hi>Phoenix;</hi> others, a Nymph of the Ocean, as the Poets in their fables) is reckoned the firſt among the parts of the World, both becauſe we inhabit it, and ſome chief Geographers have inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein; alſo becauſe it is more manured than other parts, and becauſe it is more famous for the warlike deeds of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> It is partly Northern, partly Weſtern, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Tropick of <hi>Cancer</hi> and the Pole Artique. Its longitude begins from the utmoſt part of Spain and the Atlantick Ocean, and ends at the River <hi>Thanais,</hi> now called <hi>Aſsaw.</hi> But that length of Europe is limited by ſome to 60 degrees, to one of which (paſſing thorow the midſt of Europe) do anſwer almoſt 10 German miles. Others have computed Europe's longitude from the River <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais</hi> to <hi>Hercules ſtrait,</hi> to continue 760 German miles. But others meaſure the length thereof by fewer miles, to wit, from the City <hi>Compoſtella</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which is 600 German miles. But from its latitude, that is, from South to North, according to moſt, is contained onely 44 degrees, beginning from <hi>Sicilie,</hi> where the Elevation of the Pole is 80 degrees, even to that region of the North in which the elevation of the Pole is 80 degrees: ſo that <hi>Europe</hi> hath 660 <hi>German</hi> miles in breadth; and ſo it is longer than broader. But others extend its breadth to 54 degrees, to wit, from Sicilie even to the very North Pole it ſelf. It is alſo bounded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt on every ſide with the Sea. From the Eaſt which lyeth to <hi>Aſia,</hi> it is bounded with the Aegean Sea, likewiſe with the Euxine Sea, with Moeotis fenne, and the River Thanais. From the Weſt it is terminated with the Atlantick ſtrait or narrow Sea. From the South, with the Mediterranean and Hercules ſtrait. From the North it is bounded with the Brittain Sea; but now others ſhut up Europe with the utmoſt bounds of the Icie Sea. <hi>Europe</hi> falls into the 4th and 9th Climate, between 10 and 20 Parallels. It is the leaſt of all parts of the World; yet the moſt worthy part: which its excellency depends, 1. On the temperature of the ayr. 2. On the fruitfulneſſe of all things. 3. From the endeavour of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33388:337"/>Tillage, which is here greater then in others. 4. From its popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſſe. 5. From the ſtudy of Mechanick Arts: for there are more cunning Workmen and Architects in <hi>Europe,</hi> than in any other part of the World. 6. From the ſtudy of liberall Arts, which both in reſpect of Languages, and alſo of Diſciplines, do more flouriſh in <hi>Europe;</hi> ſo that in no part of the World more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous books are written and ſet forth, Schools do no where more flouriſh, than in <hi>Europe.</hi> Seventhly, From its Empires, which are no where greater and famouſer than in EUROPE: and ſo from its Juſtice or Right, Diſcipline or Government, and Laws. Eighthly and laſtly, from Chriſt's Religion, which is no where more frequently and freely preached and profeſſed than there. And <hi>Pliny</hi> long ago ſaid, <hi>Europe</hi> was the nouriſher of the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people of all Nations, not to be compared to <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> in bigneſſe, but in vertue: It's Countries are partly Continents, partly Pen-inſulae or almoſt Iſlands, and Iſlands. The Countries that are Continents, are <hi>Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Sclavonia, Greece, Hungary, Poland,</hi> with <hi>Lituania,</hi> and <hi>Boruſcia, Ruſſia,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which is contained <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> or white <hi>Ruſsia.</hi> It's Peninſulae are chiefly <hi>Norway, Swethland, Gothland.</hi> The Iſlands in the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, are <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland, Ireland.</hi> In the Mediterranean Sea, <hi>Sicily, Sardinia; Corſica, Creet,</hi> at this day called <hi>Candy, Majorica</hi> Iſland, and <hi>Minorica.</hi> Kingdomes in <hi>Europe,</hi> are chiefly Ten, 1. The <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> 2. The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> under which are the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh;</hi> now having changed the name of Kingdome into a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctourſhip. 3. The <hi>Daniſh,</hi> under which is <hi>Norway.</hi> 4. The <hi>Swediſh,</hi> under which is the <hi>Gothiſh.</hi> 5. The <hi>Polonian.</hi> 6. The <hi>Hungarian.</hi> 7. The <hi>Bohemian.</hi> 8. The <hi>German.</hi> 9. The <hi>French.</hi> To which may be added the <hi>Italian,</hi> although (at this day) it fall not under the name of a Kingdome. But the head of <hi>Europe</hi> was once called <hi>Rome</hi> toward the Weſt, but <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> toward the Eaſt; whence ſome think the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperour ſets a two headed Eagle in his Arms; to wit, that one may look toward the Eaſt, to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> the other toward the Weſt, to <hi>Rome.</hi> Tongues throughout <hi>Europe</hi> are eſpecially three. The <hi>Roman</hi> with the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, French,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The <hi>Teutonick,</hi> among the <hi>Helveti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Germans, Bavarians, Swedes, Norwegians, Danes, Engliſh,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Belgians</hi> or Low-Countries. The <hi>Sclavonian</hi> in <hi>Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia, Polonia, Bohemia, Hungary.</hi> But all particular Countries have divers Dialects in their own Tongue, and in ſome places Languages are heard, whereof there is no commerce or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with others; as in <hi>Britain, Armorica, Navarre,</hi> &amp;c. The Seas of <hi>Europe</hi> are three. 1. The <hi>Ocean.</hi> 2. The <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, which beginning from the outmoſt part of <hi>Spain,</hi> about the Iſlands <hi>Gades,</hi> is carried from the Weſt, through the South into the North, where afterward it is called the <hi>Euxine</hi>-Sea, although ſome may think the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> to flow from the <hi>Euxine</hi>-Sea. Laſtly, the third Sea of <hi>Europe,</hi> is the <hi>Baltick,</hi> which beginning from the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Helleſpont, and the City <hi>Lubeck,</hi> is extended
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33388:338"/>about an hundred and fifty Miles between <hi>Saxony, Pomerania, Swethland, Boruſsia, Livonia,</hi> and the oppoſite ſhores of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Finland,</hi> even to <hi>Wiburg</hi> toward the Eaſt. The chief Rivers of <hi>Europe,</hi> are <hi>Danubius,</hi> which extends it ſelf to 300 <hi>Germane</hi> Miles, and riſing ſix Miles above <hi>Tubinge,</hi> receiving ſixty ſmall Rivers into it, poures forth it ſelf through <hi>Germany, Hungary, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia, Servia, Thrace,</hi> with ſeven Mouths into the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther River is <hi>Rhene</hi> (ſeparating <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Germany</hi>): after that follows <hi>Albis, Iſtula, Boryſthenes, Thamis.</hi> The principall Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in <hi>Europe,</hi> are the <hi>Alps,</hi> which ſeperate <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> from <hi>Italy;</hi> then follow the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, which ſeperate <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi> likewiſe the <hi>Carpathian</hi> Mountains. And let theſe things fuffice of <hi>Europe</hi> in generall: The ſcituation, Riches, and commodities of whoſe ſeverall Countries, together with their Religion, I ſhall (for brevity ſake) but onely name.</p>

                     <hi>SCOTLAND</hi> (ſometimes called <hi>Albania,</hi> and whoſe Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh-men which keep their ancient ſpeech ſtill, call it <hi>Albain</hi>) is the Northern part of <hi>Brittain:</hi> which the two Rivers <hi>Tweed</hi> and <hi>Solvay</hi> divide from <hi>England</hi> toward the South. It was named <hi>Scotland,</hi> from <hi>Scoti, Scitti,</hi> or <hi>Scythi,</hi> a people of <hi>Germany,</hi> unto whoſe Northern parts, even the name of <hi>Scythia</hi> was given: which people ſeizing on a part of Spain, and then on Ireland, poſſeſſed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33388:338"/>the Weſt part of this Country in the year 424. The people are divided into Highlanders and Lowlanders, according to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie's ſcituation: many of the former being uncivil, if not barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Among the many Provinces herein, is <hi>Louden,</hi> (once called <hi>Pictland,</hi> or a Country, hilly, and without trees) in which ſtands <hi>Edenborough,</hi> the Mother City, the abode of the Scottiſh Kings, before that, after the death of <hi>England</hi>'s Queen, <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> all <hi>Brittain</hi> was (by King <hi>James</hi> of Scotland, who was next heir to <hi>England's</hi> Crown) united under one King: and ſince more than that, made one Common-wealth, under a Protectour, through the Conqueſt of Scotland by the Engliſh. It is 480 miles in length, (though narrow) and 160 longer than <hi>England,</hi> which yet is much broader than it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>WALES</hi> (ſeparated from England on the Eaſt; whoſe moſt certain limit, is a great Ditch reaching from the River <hi>Wie</hi>'s flowing into <hi>Severn</hi> unto <hi>Cheſter,</hi> where <hi>Dee</hi> runs into the Sea; and called <hi>Claudh Offa,</hi> or <hi>Offa</hi>'s Ditch, King of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> by whom it was made,) is generally conceived to be ſo named, from the Brittains fleeing thither from the Saxons, who had ſeizure of <hi>England: Walls</hi> or <hi>Welſhmen,</hi> importing Aliens. Some derive it from <hi>Idwallo, Cadwallader</hi>'s ſon, who retired hither with his few Brittains. But the Brittons bringing their pedegree from the Gaules, whom the French ſtill call Galloys, and the Country, Galles, (thence Saxon-like, <hi>G.</hi> being changed into <hi>W,</hi> is <hi>Walloys</hi> or <hi>Walles,</hi> and ſo <hi>wales,</hi> (ſome alſo of <hi>France</hi> being called <hi>Walloons</hi>) makes ſome to be of this opinion. It is the leaſt of the three Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, conteining four Cities: and was called a dominion or Princedome, a Title given to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings eldeſt ſon: by means of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, who cauſed his Wife to be delivered at <hi>Carnarvon</hi> of a young ſon <hi>Edward;</hi> whom the Brittiſh Lords ſware to obey; when as before they mainly withſtood to have a general <hi>Engliſh</hi> Vice-gerent over them.</p>
                  <p>The chief Merchandiſes are, Wool, <hi>Englands</hi> ſtaple commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, whoſe Cloath divers Nations buy before any other; Tin, Lead, Beer; (Gold and Silver Mines there are none); beſides plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Corn and Cattle, eſpecially in <hi>England</hi> and Wales, for <hi>Scotland</hi> is in ſome places lean and barren; Wolves alſo the whole Iſland is free of. Their Religion, ſince deſerting <hi>Rome,</hi> is <hi>Calviniſm</hi> generally; Yet <hi>England</hi> (in its Biſhops times) had the doctrine of <hi>Geneva,</hi> but the Ceremonies of <hi>Rome;</hi> from which (then) there were ſome diſſenters. <hi>Scotland</hi> came nearer to <hi>Geneva</hi> in both. But of late years, though the Ceremonics be laid aſide alſo; yet are there many who make ſeparation both in doctrine and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, from that Church.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo many leſſer Iſlands belonging to <hi>Brittain,</hi> as the thirty two Iſles of <hi>Orkney,</hi> or <hi>Orcades,</hi> Northward of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe chief is <hi>Pomonia;</hi> whoſe head town is <hi>Kirkwall;</hi> who in latter times were held by the <hi>Normans,</hi> or <hi>Norwegians,</hi> till that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33388:339"/>King in 1266, ſurrendred them to <hi>Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by reaſon of its ſcituation. North of theſe is <hi>Shetland,</hi> ſuppoſed by many to be <hi>Thule,</hi> the utmoſt Iſland known to the antients, one of whoſe Iſles, <hi>Hethy,</hi> uſe the <hi>Gothiſh</hi> tongue from the <hi>Norwegians:</hi> and for that Marriners call it <hi>Thylenſell,</hi> under which <hi>Thule</hi> is cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: Yet <hi>Iceland</hi> (of which hereafter) is generally conceived to be <hi>Thule,</hi> it being the remoteſt part of the Northern World: but weightier reaſon out of <hi>Solinus</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> are againſt it. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there are 44 Hebrides or Weſtern Iſlands, on the Weſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> bought alſo of <hi>Magnus</hi> of <hi>Norway,</hi> by <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe Inhabitants called <hi>Red-ſhanks,</hi> are like the wild Iriſh in behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and ſpeech; in one of which, (to wit) <hi>Jona,</hi> is the chief Town Sodore, notable for the Scottiſh Kings Sepulchres. <hi>Scilly</hi> Iſlands ſcituated 24 miles from the Weſt of Corn wall in England, are 145 in all, ten whereof are onely eſteemed, as Scilly; the others Denominater, Armath, &amp;c. Whither alſo the <hi>Romans</hi> baniſhed condemned men, to work in their Mines. The <hi>Dutch</hi> call them Sorlings. Other Iſlands lie diſperſed, and belong to <hi>Englands</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth: whereof the chief are five; two whereof, <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and <hi>Guarnſey,</hi> are the onely remainders of <hi>France</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh. Jerſey</hi> being the bigger and fruitfuller, containing twelve Towns or Villages; the other, 10 Pariſhes. They are 20 Miles aſſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, lying nigh to Normandy and Britain in <hi>France,</hi> and uſing the <hi>French</hi> tongue. <hi>Wight</hi> Iſland (which being ſevered from the main Land by a narrow ſtrait of the Sea, and but a mile over in one place, may well be ſaid to be of <hi>England,</hi> though not in <hi>England</hi>) lyeth Southward from thence, being 20. or 21 miles long, and 12 broad, and is ſtrongly ſeated and ſtrengthened, whoſe chief Town at this day is <hi>Newport,</hi> a ſmall mile from whence is <hi>Carisbrook</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, very ſtrongly ſcituated: there was wont to be arms therein for 5000 men: and in every Village a piece of Ordnance for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. It belongs to <hi>Hampſhire;</hi> and did (it ſeems) appertain to the <hi>Britains,</hi> from whom it was taken by <hi>Wolphar</hi> King of Mercia. <hi>Angleſey</hi> (once the ſeat of the <hi>Druides,</hi> and bordering on <hi>Carnarvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> of Wales) is accounted a ſhire thereof: which containing formerly a multitude of Towns and Villages in ſo little room, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but 20 miles long, and ſeventeen broad, hath now the chief, Newburg, Beaumorris, and Aberfraw on its South-ſide. <hi>Man</hi>-Iſland, ſcituated 25 miles from the South of Cumberland, the North of <hi>England,</hi> is thirty miles long, and fifteen broad in the broadeſt place: and whoſe chief Towns are Ruſſin, or Caſtle Town: and <hi>Balacuri.</hi> It hath ſeventeen Pariſhes. Their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is <hi>Norwegian</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> mixt; they are ſaid to have two good properties; to hate thieving and begging. On a Hill herein called Sceafull, both <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> may (in clear weather) be ſeen. This Countrey preſerving venemous creatures alive brought into it, ended the controverſy between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> concerning it. And here alſo is that wonderfull thing wherewith <hi>Gerard</hi> the Herbariſt ends his book, to wit, <hi>Geeſebred</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:33388:339"/>of rotten Wood, falling (from Trees) into the Water.

                  <p>There are (moreover) Northern Iſlands lying in the Scythick Sea or Icy Ocean ſo called: by the <hi>Cymbrians,</hi> the dead; by <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> the dull or ſlow Sea: the chief whereof are <hi>Greenland</hi> under the cold Zone; yet known to have graſſe; and they ſay, there are people that dwell in Caves, delighting in witchcraft. <hi>Iceland,</hi> to be mentioned elſewhere. <hi>Freezland,</hi> not <hi>Frizia</hi> in <hi>Belgium,</hi> almoſt as big as <hi>Ireland. Nova Zemla:</hi> And laſtly, that which Sir <hi>Hugh Willoughby</hi> diſcovered in 1553; whereabouts, he was with his men frozen to death, going to find out a new way towards <hi>Cathaia</hi> and <hi>China:</hi> which deſign, others proſecuting, have gone to the River <hi>Obi,</hi> the Eaſtern Confines of Muſcovie, which is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but half way to <hi>China.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Iſlands have their ſeveral Commodities even as <hi>Brittain</hi> to whom they appertain. The <hi>Orcades</hi> are in a meaſure populous and fertile, and <hi>Pomonia</hi> is well ſtored with Tin and Lead. <hi>Scilly</hi> Iſlands are ſtored with Graſſe, Grain, and Lead. St. <hi>Maries</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficiently fruitful. <hi>Man</hi> hath not onely enough Corn, Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and Fiſh for it ſelf, but ſends good ſtore into other Countries. <hi>Angleſey,</hi> for its abundance of neceſſaries for man's life, is called <hi>Mam Cymry,</hi> that is, the Mother of <hi>Wales. Wight</hi> hath plenty of all ſuſtenance, whoſe ſheep bear fine Wooll, and Trees, ſtore of fruit. <hi>Jarſey</hi> abounds in grain; and of ſheep, moſt, with 4 horns, of whoſe Wooll they make Jarſey-ſtockings. <hi>Garnſey</hi> (formerly <hi>Sarnia</hi>) is well enough, though inferiour (as was ſaid) to <hi>Jarſey</hi> in fruitfulneſſe. As for their Religion, 'tis according to that of the main Iſland, onely <hi>Jarſey</hi> and <hi>Garnſey</hi> have long followed <hi>Geneva's</hi> Church Diſcipline: which is much affected by the Proteſtant Miniſters of <hi>France.</hi>

But it of late years bloudily breaking out again, occaſioned a ſecond Conqueſt of that people, and a confinement of them unto one Province. Some are conformable to civility, but the <hi>Kerns</hi> or wild <hi>Iriſh</hi> exceeding barbarous. They are generally ſtrong and nimble: and will skip over the bogs (of which there are many) without ſinking, whereas others cannot do ſo. The Ayre being Rainy, is moiſt and Rheumatick; ſo that both inhabitants, as well as ſtrangers, are much troubled with Catarrhs, and the Blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Flux: It is hilly, Mooriſh, and full of Woods, expoſed to Winds, and many pools, even in the top of the higheſt Mountains. There is much Cattle, wherefore they abound in Milk, Cheeſe, and Butter; their Corn is but ſhort and ſmall; and through the cold winds there blowing, and the Suns want of force in Autumn, the Grapes do not very well Ripen. Yet they neither much ſeek ſhade in Summer, nor fire through Winters rigour. There are good Horſes, and light, for that Countries journies, called Hobbeys. They abound in fiſh, both of Sea and freſh Water; The chief River being <hi>Shennin, Sinei,</hi> or <hi>Shannon,</hi> which runs from <hi>Ulſter,</hi> two hundred miles, to the <hi>Vergivian</hi> Sea, and is Navigable ſixty miles. Much Fowl there is, but no Storks, Pies, or Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales. No hurtfull beaſts are there, beſides Wolves and Foxes. But there is no venemous beaſt or Serpent at all.

Then was this the Royal Seat; In which <hi>Solomon</hi> built the magnificent Temple, the place of general worſhip: which being deſtroyed by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of Babylon in the 1350th year of the World, was (after the Jews return from Captivity) rebuilt; the Workmen holding their ſwords in one hand, and tools in the other, through the great oppoſition of the Samaritans. Yet was it not outwardly in divers reſpects ſo glorious as the former: But the Lord promiſed (by the Prophet) it ſhould be more glorious: which was fulfilled not onely by Chriſt the light of the World, his perſonal preaching glad tydings therein; but eſpecially by dwelling in his Saints, of whoſe bodies (which are his Temple) that was but a type. <hi>Herod</hi> the Aſcalonite, in favour of the Jews, plucking it down, made it much exceed the ſecond, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what inferiour to the firſt.

And in the 136 year of Chriſt, (through 2 rebellions by them rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) they were by <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour, in general baniſhed never there to inhabit but as ſtrangers: ſince which, they being diſperſed over the Earth, have been baniſhed out of <hi>England</hi> firſt; then out of <hi>France, Spain, Portugal, Naples,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sicily.</hi> Yet are there many in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Poland, Amſterdam</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> (where they have a Synagogue) <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and chiefly <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, with the Pope's juriſdiction of <hi>Avignion:</hi> which permiſſion of them under the Pope, although an expectation of their converſion be the declared reaſon; yet conſidering the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts Image-worſhip, whereby they are ſtumbled: and they alſo not being ſuffered to ſee ſo much as the New Teſtament: as alſo, that at their converſion, they muſt likewiſe convert all their goods to the Church, as ill-gotten; it may be rather judged to be from profit hereby ariſing.

The Jews had 16 Judges, 415 years; <hi>Moſes</hi> being the firſt, and <hi>Samuel</hi> the laſt: who having judged them four years; in the year of the World 2873, they deſired a King like other Nations.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33388:364"/>driven from <hi>Mecha</hi>'s Territories by their Nobility; the which he (ere long) ſubduing, expelled thence the Greek Officers.

Although <hi>Selimus</hi> the Firſt, ſubdued the Arabians to the Turk; yet are they rather tributaries than provinces of that Empire; for they have two Kings of their own, one whereof liveth on Euphrates, the deſarts of Meſopotamia; ſometimes in Arabia Foelix, and in ſome parts of Syria: the other wandreth with his tribes or wild theeviſh Arabs, tents, and Beſtial, one while in <hi>Petraea</hi> and <hi>Deſerta;</hi> ſometimes in Paleſtine, as he findeth good paſtorage and freſh fountains; which makes the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to and in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> ſo dangerous.

                        <hi>Anatolia,</hi> or Leſſer <hi>Aſia</hi> enjoying a ſweet and temperate Ayr, did abound likewiſe with grain, having ſtore of good paſtures for Cattle; and had more than ſufficiency for the life of man. But now it is not ſo fruitfull, as not ſo well manured; yet it is more fertile in places near the Sea; and as the land is better husbanded, ſo it yields the more. In the great Plains within the heart of the Country, they ſow Wheat, Barley, and Cotton. <hi>Natolia</hi> hath the benefit of many Rivers watering it; whereof five of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal diſcharge themſelves into the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea; three into the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontides;</hi> one into <hi>Helleſpont;</hi> four into the <hi>Archipelago:</hi> one runs into <hi>Euphrates;</hi> and divers others into the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea. But the chief revenue of <hi>Natolia</hi> is by Cotton, whereof there growes abundance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bythinia</hi> imparts its Orpiment to other Nations. <hi>Galatia</hi> hath great yearly profit by Copper-Mines. <hi>Caria</hi> a good revenue by the Adamant ſtone. The <hi>Pamphilians</hi> make the beſt of Chamlets, and have great ſums of money for them. <hi>Cappadocia</hi> is enriched by Silver, Iron, Allom, Jaſper, Cryſtal, Alabaſter, and the Onyx ſtone. And <hi>Cilicia</hi> receives much money for its ſtore of Chamlets made of Goats-hair, which is there very ſoft, and delicate as ſilk. <hi>Judea</hi> reaps much profit by Pilgrims going yearly to the Holy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33388:365"/>
                        <hi>Phoenicia</hi> is much frequented for its great traffique: But <hi>Arabia the Happy</hi> exceeds them all in Merchandiſe, and by reaſon of the Spices, precious ſtones, and Pearls there ſold to ſtrange Merchants, is exceeding rich; and it yields Incenſe for all the World. <hi>Mecha</hi> hath great traffique, unto which <hi>Aethiopian, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> and other Merchants come; and (together with <hi>Medina</hi>) is enricht yearly by Pilgrimages. <hi>Aden</hi> exceeds any other in traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique for the abundance of Commodities brought thither from India, Perſia, and Aethiopia, which are fetcht and ſold from thence at a dear rate; for they are a witty people in Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing matters. As touching Religion, there are many of divers Religions and ſects in theſe Countries beſides the Mahometans. Jews are diſperſed all over them: and thoſe that profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, ſome obey, and others are divided from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The firſt ſort, are great numbers of Merchants of <hi>Venice, Ragouſe, France,</hi> &amp;c. trading to <hi>Tripoli, Damaſco, Aleppo,</hi> &amp;c. being aſſiſted by them of the Order of <hi>Francis</hi> who dwell in Jeruſalem and Bethelem: and a few among the <hi>Armenians</hi> alſo, are found following the Latine Church. There was 25 Villages under the juriſdiction of <hi>Alangiacana</hi>-Caſtle, two dayes journey from <hi>Tauris,</hi> who (though they ſpake the <hi>Armenian</hi> tongue) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Rome. This was in 1337; which Inhabitants are ſaid to be then converted by one <hi>Bartholomew</hi> a <hi>Dominican,</hi> who was made Biſhop of Armenia (I ſuppoſe the leſſer); but now 12 only do perſiſt in obedience thereunto: ſome of the other 13 having ſubmitted to the Patriarch of the greater <hi>Armenia,</hi> and the others being ruined during the Turkiſh and Perſian Wars. The 12 Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages are aſſiſted in religious matters by the Dominicans under an Archbiſhop of that order, who being made by their Chapiter, and the chief of the Villages, is confirmed by the Pope. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines had alſo Synagogues at Burſia and Trebyſond or Trapezond; but they with the Latine Ceremonies being loſt for lack of Prieſts to officiate, either the Grecian or Armenian Religion hath ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. For the Armenians differ from them, 1. In receiving Infants to the Supper immediately after Baptiſm. 2. In abſtinence from unclean beaſts. 3. In faſting on Chriſtmas-day ſo called. 4. In holding their children over the fire in Baptiſm, as a needful circumſtance, becauſe <hi>John</hi> told the people, That Chriſt ſhould baptize them with the holy Spirit and fire. The other ſorts are divided into three ſects, <hi>Melchites,</hi> ſo named from <hi>Melech,</hi> that is, a King or Prince, as following the Emperour's of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>'s example: Such are all they of the Greeks religion in <hi>Aſia</hi> under the four fore-mentioned Patriarchs of <hi>Conſtantinople, Jeruſalem, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch;</hi> this laſt reſiding at <hi>Damaſco:</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choſen by the Country Biſhops, ſeek not now the Pope's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, (as formerly) but a liberty to chooſe, from the Turkiſh Baſhaw, and the Turks own confirming, exerciſing their power under his authority. Theſe chooſe and conſecrate the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and Biſhops under them: ſome of whom have recourſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:33388:365"/>to the Pope for confirmation. They are all Monks of <hi>Baſil;</hi> the famouſeſt of which many Covents throughout the <hi>Levant,</hi> are thoſe in Jeruſalem, on Mount Sinai, and the holy Mountain upon the Archipelago. Theſe hold all that the Greeks of old condemned as erroneous at the Councel of <hi>Florence;</hi> and are thought to be more than all the reſt, <hi>Natolia</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> being full of them; they extending alſo into Egypt, and Corazzan of Perſia. Some alſo place the <hi>Georgians</hi> among them: who (as one) acknowledg the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>'s authority: yet ſome ſay, they agree in moſt doctrinal points with the Greeks, but not acknowledging the ſaid Patriarch; but have one of their own: who being moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſident on Mount Sinai, hath 18 Biſhops under him. They call ('tis ſaid) on St. <hi>George</hi> as their Advocate: But take not their name from him, as was before ſhewn. Some of them have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mahometans. <hi>Neſtorians</hi> are alſo in theſe Countries, ſo called from <hi>Neſtorius</hi> the Leader of their formerly condemned hereſie: who ſpeaking the languages of the places where they live, do not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding celebrate their Liturgie in the Chaldean tongue. The third ſect are <hi>Dioſcoriens,</hi> which are likewiſe divided into three Armenians, who although they give the title of Patriarch to many of their Prelates who farm the Turk's Armenian tributes, and are made partly by his favour; yet call but two Univerſal Patriarchs, the one being over the high, the other over the Low-Armenia. They are not much leſſe in number than the <hi>Melchites;</hi> who have great liberty in all the Turk's eſtate, both for their policy in Trade, and for ſome teſtimonies of their predeceſſour's affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Mahomet:</hi> who paſſionately recommended them to his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours. They have no Images, but croſſes of braſſe and iron, yet have they divers reliques in ſhrines of ſilver: they ſay Service in their own language. Thoſe things wherein they differ from the other <hi>Dioſcoriens</hi> are, 1. Celebrating their Sacrament with unleavened bread, therein being conformable to Rome beyond all the Eaſtern Sectaries: they put alſo no water in their wine, ſaying, the Latine Church uſed anciently the ſame; they eat figgs and milk on Saturday night before Eaſter; eating alſo fleſh every Friday from Eaſter to the Aſcenſion. They differ in the time of celebrating the Annunciation and Nativity. They ſay, Chriſt was exempt from paſſions, and neceſſities of humane nature. They make the ſign of the Croſſe with two fingers, firſt on the right ſide, then on the left, contrary to the Jacobites.</p>
                     <p>For their killing nor buying any fleſh five Saturdayes of the year, in remembrance of the Idolaters ſacrificing their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Idols, and in a different ordering the Lamb in their Maſs for the dead before they kill it; ſome call them Sabbatins and Julianiſts. Yet they remember their firſt union with Rome's Church, in Pope <hi>Silveſter,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great's time. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites,</hi> denominated from one <hi>Jacob,</hi> a Syrian, a follower of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcores</hi> and <hi>Eutyches;</hi> the chief of whom are in Aleppo, Caramit, and Tur, a Mountain of Meſopotamia. They had two Patriarchs;

They celebrate in the Chaldean tongue, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the Armenians; in making the ſign of the croſſe with the fore-finger onely, to ſignifie a oneneſſe of nature, will, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in Chriſt. They eat alſo milk and fleſh on Wedneſday and Friday night after Sun-ſet, ſaying, Then the term of abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is paſt: eating fleſh all the year long but in Lent. Some Arabians living among them, have joyned to them, who ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It is the leaſt of all the Eaſtern ſects, there being not above 12000 houſholds, moſt of whom are poor; yet they are the moſt affected to the See of Rome, whoſe Patriarch being of <hi>Anthonies</hi> Order, and choſen by their Biſhops and Religious on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

They pray to <hi>Maron,</hi> not (ſay they) the Arch-heretique, (from whom, 'tis generally held, they derive their name) but an Abbot of a very holy life: or elſe are ſo called from <hi>Marona</hi> a Village of Mount <hi>Libanon.</hi> Some are found among theſe, called White: who not being baptized, and in outward ſhew Mahometans, do call themſelves Chriſtians, confeſſing and communicating in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.

                     <p>Before I paſſe to <hi>Aſsyria,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall ſtrike in with thoſe two noted Iſlands of the Mediterranean Sea, <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Cyprus. Rhodes</hi> lying in the <hi>Carpathian</hi> Sea over-againſt <hi>Caria,</hi> had of old divers names, as <hi>Ithrea, Trinacria,</hi> &amp;c.

                        </gap>, ſignifying a Roſe; nigh whoſe chief City Rhodes (which ſtands on the Eaſt part of the Iſle, the ſide of a hill, and part on the Sea-ſhore, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying a fair and ſafe Haven, having alſo two or three Walls, five Caſtles, 13 high Towers, and ſome other Forts, making it even impregnable) at the entry of the Haven, ſtood that huge Idol of braſſe, (in a man's image) called <hi>Coloſsus,</hi> one of the world's ſeven Wonders: whoſe thumb was ſo big, that no man could embrace it with both arms; and its little finger as big as an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary man. Some ſay it was built by <hi>Canete Lindo</hi> in 12 years ſpace; others, by <hi>Callaſses Lyſippus</hi> his Schollar, taking the name
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:33388:366"/>
                        <hi>Coloſsus</hi> of him. It was 80 cubits high, and erected in honour of the Sun; (which is ſaid, once a day to ſhine on this Iſland, though never ſo cloudy in other places) between whoſe leggs, (it ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Harbour's mouth) ſhips with ſails were wont to paſſe under. Whether the people were hence called <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; but thoſe <hi>Coloſsians</hi> to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, were dwellers in <hi>Anatolia,</hi> of which mention hath been made. <hi>Mnavi Caliph, Oſman</hi>'s General, uniting this Iſle to the Mahometan Empire, he brake down moſt of this Image, the braſſe whereof is ſaid to have loaded 900 Camels: yet its reliques were ſeen within this 60 or 80 years by a travailler into <hi>Rhodes.</hi> When the Knights of <hi>John</hi> of Jeruſalem were driven out of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> by the Turks, this Iſland was given by the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Emperour unto them, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the Saracens from thence in 1308, who formerly took it from the divided Greeks; who having ſorely infeſted the Turks nigh 200 years, <hi>Solyman</hi> the magnificent invading it, and beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>Lilladamus Villiers</hi> (with about 500 of his Knights, 5000 <hi>Rhodians</hi> aſſiſting them) by an Army of 200000 Turks, and 300 Galleys, 6 moneths; in one of the two ſtrong Fortreſſes of the City, they reſolutely defended it to the utmoſt of valour or warlike policy, till multitude over-maſtering both, <hi>Solyman</hi> entred the Town on Chriſtmas day ſo called, in 1522: the Knights yielding it on condition to depart, with liberty, goods, and tranſportation; and the Countrie's Inhabitants to continue there ſtill if they would: yet the Turk loſt ſo many of his beſt Souldiers, and brave Commanders, that (as one ſaith) he might have ſaid with <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus, Such another Victory would have utterly undone him.</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained long after without a habitation; till the King of <hi>Spain</hi> gave them the barren Iſle of <hi>Malta. Rhodes</hi> hath been much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to overflowing of waters, wherewith in 25 years ſpace it was three times afflicted, and mightily indangered by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſtorms of rain; the laſt of which beginning (when <hi>Antigonus</hi> vanquiſhed <hi>Eumenes</hi>) with hail at the entrance of the ſpring, the whole Iſland was covered with water, and the inhabitants drowned; many houſes were beaten down, many kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the Town in a manner ruined thereby, but they ſince la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to drain the waters, and dry up the moors, the Country hath been fruitfull, and not ſubject to ſuch inundations. It abounds in paſtures, great ſtore of Olive-Trees, Olives, and Citrons, with other Trees, continually green, and near the Town it ſelf, there are many Valleys and ſmall hills, with ſtore of Fruit-Trees and Vines; but they grow all by induſtry, not naturally. Theſe Iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were ſo expert in Sea-affairs, that <hi>Florus</hi> calls them <hi>Populus Nauticus,</hi> or a Sea-people; they made couragious defence againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> before ſubjected unto them; but then ever faithfull, who (of all the Mediterranean Iſles, that revolted in <hi>Mithridates</hi> his time) ſtood onely faſt to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſo that <hi>Velleius Paterculus</hi> makes it almoſt a miracle, that (in the <hi>Romans</hi> hard wars with <hi>Perſeus</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi>) the very <hi>Rhodians</hi> that before were moſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:33388:367"/>faithfull to the <hi>Romans,</hi> now (by a doubtfull faith) ſeemed to be more inclinable to the Kings part. The Town is onely inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Jews;</hi> Chriſtians may not abide therein in the night on pain of death, for fear of ſedition or Treaſon; by day, they may either continue, or trade there without exception. But thoſe in the Villages are moſt Chriſtians, and thoſe Greeks who manure their fields, and dreſſe their Vines and Gardens; and whoſe manner of living is moſtly like other Grecians; I ſuppoſe the Authors meaning is, both in Religion and behaviour. <hi>Rhodes</hi> was an old Academy of the Roman Monarchy, on the Weſt ſide of which Iſle (which is 120 miles in circuit) lieth <hi>Carpathos,</hi> now <hi>Scarpanto,</hi> 70 miles in compaſſe; eminent onely for giving the name of the <hi>Carpathian</hi> Sea to the adjoyning waters.</p>

                        <hi>CYPRUS</hi> (ſcituated according to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> in the midſt of the <hi>Iſsick</hi>-bay, called the Gulf of <hi>Laiazza</hi>) lies between <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi>'s Coaſts, and is about an 100 miles from <hi>Syria</hi> South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, having <hi>Aegypt</hi> on the Weſt, and <hi>Cilicia</hi> on the Eaſt. It's length extending from Eaſt to Weſt, is (by a traveller thither) reputed 210 miles, 60 broad, and 600 in circuit. It fell into the <hi>Romans</hi> hands, after the <hi>Aſsyrian</hi> Monarchies extinguiſhment, (which before was under the dominion of <hi>Greek</hi> Tyrants) by whoſe means the <hi>Ptolomies</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> commanded it. Then retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning again under the <hi>Romans</hi> by <hi>M. Cato,</hi> who conquered it, and found therein 7000 Talents in money and goods; which ſumme, fearing to loſe, in bringing it to <hi>Rome</hi> by Sea, he put it into ſeveral boxes, to wit, two Talents and fifty drachms in a box: at the end whereof, he faſtening a long rope, with a piece of Cork at the end, that, if it ſuffered ſhipwrack, it might be eſpied.

Sangue</hi> which ſome call <hi>Citor,</hi> and whoſe chief City is <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> twelve miles in compaſſe, ſeated in an advantagious place, and very ſtrongly fortified. This Province was (but lately) ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto a fair and couragious woman named <hi>Crementina,</hi> yet a Tributary to <hi>Badurius</hi> of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> from whom ſhe revolting, he diſpoſſeſſed her of the Town, where ſhe had fortified her ſelf with no leſſe then 30000 foot and 2000 horſe. There is alſo the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Bocan,</hi> or <hi>Balaſsia,</hi> which hath two Cities of the ſame names; and which conteineth inexhauſtible Mines of Gold and Silver. This Empire hath been conquered and contracted into one, by the great <hi>Mogulls,</hi> about 120 years or more: who were ſo called from the <hi>Mongull Tartars,</hi> from whom they deſcended by cutting off a Letter, and ſo likewiſe (I ſuppoſe) <hi>Mogors.</hi> This Countrey hath been notable, for abundance of, both neceſſaries for life, and alſo of pleaſure; likewiſe for ſundry beaſts, as Apes, Dragons, Camells, Serpents, Rhicinerots; and Elephants. <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baia</hi> abounds in Wheat, Rice, Sugar, all ſorts of fruits, Spices, and Incenſe, fraughting alſo ſometimes 40 or 50 ſhips (to tranſport in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other parts) with their great ſtore of Cotton, and Silk. Here is alſo found the Onyx ſtone, called Cornallina, many Diamonds and Chalcedonies; it abounds alſo in liquid Storax. It is watered chiefly with the River <hi>Indus,</hi> comming from Mount <hi>Caucoſus. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala</hi> alſo hath great ſtore of Rice, Wheat, Sugar, very good Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and long Pepper, no Countrey having more fleſh or Fiſh, or more Silk and Cotton, beſides its ſweet and temperate Ayre, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting many people thither. And the Jews and Mahometans there dwelling, believe that the ſweet and pleaſant fruit of their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:33388:377"/>Trees called <hi>Moſes,</hi> was that which tempted <hi>Adam.</hi> Here are Canes ſo big, that they ſerve for barrels, &amp;c. <hi>Dellie</hi> alſo abounds in Horſes, Dromedaries, which ſome call Abades, twice as big as a Bull, and Elephants, beſides the commodities of other Realms; So that the enriching Merchandiſes of this Empire, which they ſend into remote Countries, are, abundance of Cotton and Silks, Spices and precious ſtones; their <hi>Mogor</hi> alſo having undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaſt treaſures, as having conquered <hi>Badurius</hi> (who brought 500 Cheſts or Tuns of Gold and Silver, as was ſaid, to pay his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my) and a great number of other Provinces. As to Religion, the <hi>Mogors</hi> Empire is for the moſt part <hi>Mahometans;</hi> alſo there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny groſſe idolaters, as may ſtraightway be declared. There are alſo many Jews, and ſome called Chriſtians, Abyſſins, whom traffique and gain draw hither. There are alſo within <hi>Ganges,</hi> the two Kingdomes of <hi>Narſinge</hi> and <hi>Calicute,</hi> governed by their own Princes. The firſt whereof, <hi>Narſinge,</hi> lyeth between the Gulf of <hi>Bengala</hi> on the Eaſt, and the Mountains of <hi>Gate</hi> on the Weſt; and is in length 600 miles, wherein are two royall Towns, <hi>Narſinge,</hi> and <hi>Biſnagar,</hi> or <hi>Beſenagal</hi> (having three walls, and famous for traffique, yet it was burnt by Saracenicall confederates in 1567) by reaſon whereof, they call this Prince ſometimes King of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge,</hi> ſometimes of <hi>Biſnagar.</hi> The City of <hi>Tanaſsar</hi> (ſome ſay) belongs to this Kingdome, though the King of <hi>Barma</hi> now holds it. The <hi>Portugals</hi> have ſeized on one principall ſea-Town hereof; namely <hi>Onor,</hi> and made another (to wit) <hi>Batticale</hi> their tributary, but theſe are in the Province of <hi>Canara,</hi> or <hi>Concan,</hi> being ſome part of <hi>Decan,</hi> which the King of <hi>Narſinge</hi> doth enjoy; who hath (likewiſe) the King of <hi>Travancor,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Malabar,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto him. But two Sea-Towns in <hi>Narſinge</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Coromandel</hi> and <hi>Malipur</hi> are inhabited by Chriſtians, the <hi>Portugalls</hi> holding them alſo. This King led an Army againſt <hi>Idalcan</hi> (a neighbour Prince) of 31690 horſe, 558 Elephants, and 60000 foot, and vanquiſhed him. In this Country is great plenty of Corn, Sugar, Ginger, and other ſpices; no place abounding more in Silk and Cotten than it. <hi>Canara,</hi> yields Rice, Sugar, Nuts, and Figs; but no Wheat, Barley, nor Pulſe. <hi>Biſnagars</hi> Territory is very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, nigh which are very pleaſant Forreſts. But <hi>Travancors</hi> ſoil is lean. This King hath twelve Millions of Gold or Duckets year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For in this Countrey (as in moſt of the Eaſt) all the lands Forreſts, Mines, yea, and the Water of ſome Rivers are the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: ſo that every one waſhing himſelf in <hi>Ganges,</hi> running thorow <hi>Bengala,</hi> or that of <hi>Gangue</hi> flowing thorow <hi>Oriſſa,</hi> muſt pay a ſum to their Kings. This people do believe, firſt in one God; then in Devills, the Authors of all evill, whom they moſt honouring, build ſtately Pagodes, or Temples unto them: and two ſorts of people, to wit, the <hi>Banean,</hi> and <hi>Bramans,</hi> or <hi>Bramins</hi> do govern in a manner the Idolatrous Religion throughout the <hi>Indies.</hi> To ſpeak of all whoſe vanities and fooliſh ſuperſtitions, might ſeem as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, as tedious. The <hi>Bramans</hi> are much more eſteemed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:33388:378"/>than the other, and are of two ſects, either thoſe who marry, and live in Towns, called <hi>Bramanes;</hi> or thoſe who never marry, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on Alms, and going up and down like Pilgrims, &amp;c. for a time, till becomming Abduts, that is, men exempt from Laws, they commit all beaſtlineſſe, and villany, and take all kind of pleaſures, and theſe are called <hi>Joques,</hi> whoſe Commander diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes ſometimes a great revenue, ſending them up and down to preach their folly. They worſhip and eſteem of Oxen and Kine more than any beaſts, becauſe they think dead mens Souls paſſe rather into them than into any other. They hold God to be black, as the goodlieſt colour; wherefore their Idols are black, and ſo deformed, that they affright the beholders, perſwading the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they are great eaters; by which lying, they get much money and meat to make good chear withall, they know the explication of the 10 Commandements: and the firſt thing they enjoyn their received Diſciples; is never to publiſh, one God Creator of all things to be worſhipped. In their Sabbath's ſervice, their Doctors repeat often theſe words, <hi>I worſhip thee, O God, with thy grace and ſuccours eternally.</hi> Alſo to receive meat from Chriſtians, they account it ſacriledge.</p>

                        <hi>CALICUTE</hi> is the chief Realm of the Country of <hi>Malabar,</hi> which is the Weſtern part of <hi>Aurea Cherſoneſus</hi> of old, which is 900 miles long, from the Mountain <hi>Guate</hi> on the Eaſt, to the <hi>Indian</hi> Ocean Eaſt; yet narrow. It contains ſeven Provinces; two of whom, to wit, <hi>Cononor</hi> and <hi>Calicute,</hi> obey the King of <hi>Calicute,</hi> a Prince ſo powerful, that they call him <hi>Zamorim</hi> or Emperour; although the Realm be but 25 leagues long, and 10 broad: for <hi>Pereimall</hi> King of <hi>Malabar</hi> going to a Mahometan <hi>Mecha,</hi> to finiſh his dayes, divided his eſtate into as many parts as Provinces, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this name to this King of <hi>Calicute.</hi> Its denominating City <hi>Calicute</hi> reacheth three miles along the Sea-ſide, without walls, the houſes being ſome diſtance from each other; yet the ſtaple-Town of all the <hi>Indian</hi> Traffique. <hi>Cononor</hi> is a City alſo, having a ſafe and large Harbour, and ſo fit for traffique 30 miles from <hi>Calicute:</hi> But <hi>Cochin</hi> is 30 leagues from the ſame, whence are the beſt ſcarlet dies; whoſe Governour is the High Prieſt of the <hi>Brachmanes</hi> or <hi>Bramins:</hi> unto whom, they ſay, the King uſes to grant the hanſel of his marriage-bed, wherefore his ſiſter's ſons ſucceed him, as being more certainly of the royal bloud. The houſes of <hi>Calicute</hi> are built low, equal to a man on horſeback, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſoon finding water, they cannot lay deep foundations. This ſoyl yields much Pepper and Ginger: in the Plains, is a fruit like the Myrobolan; but in the reddiſh ſoiles, are gathered all ſorts thereof. They have divers ſhrubs and fruits, among which ſome (unknown to us) taſte like Peaches, Damask-Prunes, Figgs, and Melons. Aloes called <hi>Succo-citrini,</hi> growes here, and is a gumme gathered from a ſhrub, having but one root, like a ſtaffe. They have a Tree yielding Dates like the Palm, wood for fuel, nuts
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33388:378"/>well-taſted: ropes and fine cloath are made of it; Wine, Sugar, and oyl are drawn from it. Another Tree bears Cotton, Cypres or Cobweb-lawn, of whoſe leaves they make ſtuffe ſomewhat like to Sattin or Taffata; making ropes of its bark being ſpun, under whoſe latter bark, is a nut as big as ones little finger, in whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part, water growing, not much unlike Roſe-water: they make fat oyl thereof. They draw mornings and evenings a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor from this Tree by inciſion, which is to them as ſweet wines. The whole year ſeems alwayes here as a Spring, through the ayr its temperateneſſe and ſweetneſſe. Here are likewiſe many beaſts, as Lyons, Bugles, Elephants, Bears, Wolves, Stags, Goats, Oxen, though ſome ſay they breed not here. Parrots there are of divers colours, and the bird Saran ſomewhat leſſe than Parrots. Store of Apes and Monkeys, who running up thoſe Trees (like Nut-trees) ſpoyl the liquor whereof the <hi>Indians</hi> make drink, overthrowing the veſſels in which they receive it. Three ſorts of Serpents are in this Country, two whereof are poyſonſome in their bitings: but the other which are very great, living in Mooriſh places; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving very long feet, are ſaid to have no poyſon in them. The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licutes</hi> ſelling not onely their own Pepper and Ginger to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants: but Spices, Musk, Incenſe, Aloes, and Camphir, Braſil, Pearls, and Caſſia, which come to this City from other places, makes it one of the richeſt in the Indies. They believe one God the Creator and firſt cauſe of all: but they ſay, He, to reſt himſelf hath committed the Earth's Government, Judgment, and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the Devil, whom they call <hi>Deume,</hi> or the god <hi>Tameran,</hi> holding him to be coeleſtial. The King hath many figures of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in a place of his Palace; and in his Chappel a gaping ghaſtly brazen Devil is ſet on a Throne of braſſe; who holds the ſoul of a man in his throat, and another in his hand to devour him. Their ſacrificers are called <hi>Bramins,</hi> who (to let paſſe their many ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions) promiſe a general pardon to the people of their faults once a year, in December; which continuing for three dayes, their Idol-Temple (whither they reſort from all neighbouring Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and into which none may enter, to worſhip or be ſprinkled with the lamp-oyl by the <hi>Bramins,</hi> till he hath waſhed himſelf in the Lake in which the Temple ſtands) is as a Sanctuary for all, ſo that none dare either purſue an offender, do wrong, or revenge for wrong done.</p>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:33388:379"/>alſo very populous; and wherein nigh 30000 families of Moots, Merchants, are eſtimated to dwell: the River overflowes the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try 120 miles every year; whereby the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> beſieging it in 1567, brought but 70000 of 900000 Souldiers with him our of the waters. <hi>Odie,</hi> bigger than <hi>Siam,</hi> for they reckon therein near 400000 houſes; and 200000 boats are ſaid to be there, in which they may paſſe thorow every ſtreet, as in <hi>Venice. Malac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> ſubject to the Portugals, who have here an Archbiſhop, with a Colledg of Jeſuits: it is eminent for the Trade of Spices, and 20 miles about. 2. <hi>Barma,</hi> whoſe Kings were but Lievtenants to the Kings of <hi>Pegu,</hi> till about 100 years ſince, or more: when as a <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> Prince ſeized on four Kingdoms; and ſince, theſe <hi>Barmians</hi> have won the City <hi>Pegu,</hi> forced <hi>Odie,</hi> and totally ſubdued <hi>Siam,</hi> making all the reſt do them homage. 3. <hi>Pegu,</hi> ſo called from the river <hi>Pegu</hi> running thorow the midſt of the Country, and on which, the moſt fair and elegant City of <hi>India</hi> of the ſame name, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, diſtant 25 miles from the Sea. In this Country, by means of the titulary King of <hi>Siam</hi> his coming and burning up corn, graſſe, and fruits, a moſt inſupportable famine conſumed all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this kingdom; except thoſe that were preſerved by the ſtore-houſes of the City in 1598. 4. <hi>Macin,</hi> whoſe chief City is <hi>Macin;</hi> which Country alſo is notable for the ſweet wood Aloes; held by the <hi>Indians</hi> a moſt excellent remedy for many grievous maladies. 5. <hi>Aracham</hi> or <hi>Arrachan,</hi> ſcituated North from <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala</hi> near the River <hi>Chabery,</hi> on which the chief Town <hi>Arrachan</hi> ſtandeth, and is 45 miles from the Sea. <hi>Ava</hi> is alſo another City hereof, remarkable for its many Gems. 6. <hi>Camboye,</hi> which takes its name from the principal City ſo called, which ſtandeth on the river <hi>Menon:</hi> which receiving into it many rivers, in its flowing out of <hi>China</hi> where it ariſeth, makes 100 Iſlands; and a Lake about 200 miles in compaſſe. 7. <hi>Cauchin China,</hi> a few of whoſe people are ſaid to be Man-eaters: Its chief City of the ſame name being ſcituate on the Sea, is much frequented for <hi>China</hi> diſhes, or <hi>Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.</hi> In the ſeveral Provinces are to be found ſeveral Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; great ſtore of Rice, Elephants, little horſes, Parrots, Civet-Catts, huge Canes, many Rubies, much Lacca, (which ſome ſay is the Gum of a Tree; others, that they gather it upon leaves) Corn, Pepper, Benjoyn, Gold, Silver, Tinn, and other metals, plenty of Musk; in ſome places great Forreſts, where live many Tygres, Lyons, and wild beaſts. There is both fleſh and fiſh, and in one place or other all things needful for the life of man: for the Country being plain, and watered with many goodly Rivers, all things abound beyond what is ſpoken. Merchants coming thither from all parts, do carry many Commodities forementioned into ſeveral parts: ſo that the wealth of theſe Realms may eaſily be conceived by their fruitfulneſſe; and that the King of <hi>Barma</hi> hath ſtore of treaſure. From the falſe and fooliſh principles of thoſe of <hi>Pegu,</hi> ſpring ſo many vain opinions and ceremonies, that they are hardly to be expreſſed. They have Convents of Prieſts near
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:33388:379"/>their Idol-Temples above 300 in a place; who have head and chin ſhaven, wearing long Gowns with ſleeves hanging to the ground. Thoſe of <hi>Siam</hi> are held, as it were, authors of all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions in theſe Countries; yet hold God for the Creator of all things, who ſhall recompence the good, and puniſh the evil: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving alſo, a man to have about him, both a good Spirit guiding him to good, and keeping him; and another tempting, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting him. They much honour their Prieſts, who are attired in yellow cloath; for all of that colour (it reſembling the Sun and gold) is dedicated to God. Many are the number of their Idols; worſhipping alſo the four Elements: ſo that he who in his life-time adored the earth, chooſes to be buried; he that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured fire, to be burnt: who the ayr, to be hung, and devoured by birds: and who the water, to be drowned.

In all theſe Countries are many Towns and Cities: (Every Town of note being built after one
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:33388:380"/>manner, to wit, two great, broad and ſtraight ſtreets croſſing each other, which end at four Gates equally diſtant, all garniſhed with iron, and ſtately, beſides other ſmaller ſtreets with publique and private buildings) and the Villages are ſo many and near each other, that their number is unknown; ſo that here are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inhabit 70 millions of people: for they are born, and do die, buy and ſell in ſhips, as if in a City. The two chief Rivers of this Country, are <hi>Polyſango</hi> and <hi>Cacamacan;</hi> on which are 12000 ſtately bridges, under whoſe arches ſhips top and top gallant, do uſually paſſe. The principal Cities are, <hi>Quinſay</hi> or <hi>Suntien,</hi> in their language an Eccleſiaſtical City, which is ſo large, that a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt make ſpeed to ride, from one gate to another in a day, the Suburbs being alſo almoſt as great as the City. The King hath here three Palaces; whereof that which ſtandeth toward the Eaſt at the Citie's entry is ſo big and full of ſingularities, that ſome report, it cannot be exactly viewed under four dayes time. It is encompaſſed with ſeven Walls, of a great ſpace aſunder; it hath 79 ſtately and admirable artificial Halls, four whereof are the principal, in which Embaſſadours have audience; (and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his Lords and Governours, when he keeps his Court; yet he ſeldom ſhews himſelf to his people out of his lodging, and is ſcarce ever ſeen, but through a glaſſe). The firſt is of mettall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly caſt, with a many figures. The ſecond hath a floor of Silver of great value. The third of pure enameld Gold. The fourth far exceeds the other three, wherefore they call it the Hall of the Kings treaſure; in which are alſo many ineſtimable Jewels and the Kings Chair made of Marble; and ſet with many pretious ſtones, and Carbuncles ſo rich, that by night they ſhine as if there were Candles; and indeed this Hall conteins whatever is rich and rare. <hi>Paquin</hi> where the King alſo reſideth, either for the health of the Ayre, or nearneſſe to the <hi>Tartars,</hi> whoſe Pallace, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with a triple Wall, within which, beſides lodgings, are Hills, Groves, Rivers, Fountains, yet is it not equall in workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the <hi>European</hi> Pallaces. <hi>Nanquin,</hi> in Circuit thirty miles, and is ſeated twenty ſeven miles from the Sea, on a fair Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble River; on which, beſides private mens, ride 10000 of the Kings Ships for the moſt part. <hi>Colius,</hi> famous for <hi>Porceline.

And amongſt others, ſtands little <hi>Tezergue,</hi> ſubject to the <hi>Arabians,</hi> being near <hi>Cunaigel Cherben</hi> a Mountain, ſignifying the paſſage of Ravens. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Xeriff</hi> of <hi>Barbary,</hi> who beginning his reign in 1550, united the Kingdomes of <hi>Fez,</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> for which Kingdome, the three ſons of <hi>Hamet</hi> contended in 1603; two of which brothren dying in thoſe wars, <hi>Abdela,</hi> ſon to one of the ſlain brothers, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the war againſt <hi>Sidan</hi> the ſurviving brother: During which one <hi>Sidan Amet,</hi> a Hermite, ſeized on the City <hi>Morocco,</hi> the which, <hi>Sidan,</hi> and <hi>Side-Hean</hi> alſo, a Hermite, forced him to leave in 1616, So that whatever the event hath been ſince; then was the <hi>Xerifate</hi> greatly diſtracted; for <hi>Sidan</hi> poſſeſſed <hi>Morocco; Side-Hean</hi> forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himſelf in <hi>Taradant; Abdela</hi> lived by robberies; <hi>Fez</hi> ſtood on its Guard; and the other Towns were governed by particular Magiſtrates of their own. Theſe people are Tawny, but ſome more than the other; they are alſo ſomewhat more civill, or elſe, much of the conditions of the <hi>Arabians;</hi> they are wondrous am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, unconſtant, ſubtile, and treacherous, alſo very cholerick, great braggers, ſuſpicious, and exceeding jealous. This Realm in general (for to ſpeak particularly of the fourteen Provinces, would be too tedious) is ſaid to abound in Corn, Fruit, Oyl, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Wax, Sugar, Goats-hair, whereof Chamlets are made, and their skins, which being dreſſed they call Marroquin-skins, and we <hi>Spaniſh</hi>-Leather; there is alſo much Cattle in divers places, alſo in <hi>Suz</hi> great ſtore of fine Amber is found; ſo that although ſome places are rough and ſtony, yet theſe inhabitants have all things needfull for life, one Country abounding in what another
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:33388:387"/>wants; and if they had not war on every occaſion, hindering a ſetled peace; this Empire would be very happy, and not envy any others commodities, for in their Mountains they feed great ſtore of Cattle, and they have likewiſe plenty of Corn; but their Plains yield ſo much corn, and fruit, that they furniſh other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with Citrons, Oranges, Sugar, and Olives. Yea, they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port into forreign Countries, Chamlets, Barbary-skins, Cotton-Cloath, and Sugar, whereof they make great profit. And for the Emperours Revenues, he is Maſter both of all his ſubjects goods and perſons, none daring to oppoſe any impoſitions laid (by him) on them; Yet the Empires uſurpation, the continuall wavering of affairs, with the fear of an accident like that of <hi>Muley Cheq,</hi> makes him ſeek to govern them the milder, that they may deſire to live alwayes under his command. All here are <hi>Mahometans</hi> except the ſlaves, which doctrine of <hi>Mahomet</hi> entred into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in 637, through the Conqueſts of <hi>Omar,</hi> then a Captain of <hi>Odman,</hi> firſt paſſed into <hi>Africk,</hi> in 650, with 80000 men, who defeating <hi>Gregory Patricius,</hi> they chaſed the <hi>Romans</hi> with the troops of <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperour, and <hi>Abſimachus,</hi> quite out of <hi>Africk,</hi> becomming Maſters of <hi>Barbary,</hi> which the <hi>Arabians</hi> increaſed, firſt by Arms, and thoſe not prevailing, by Preaching and Traffique. The <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandalls</hi> who inhabited <hi>Africk,</hi> being infected with the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> opinion, much helped herein; for they brought in the <hi>Arabian</hi> letters and language, building Univerſities at <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Fez,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alſo great Revenues thereto; But nothing hath more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Mahomets</hi> ſect than the Victories of the <hi>Miramamolins</hi> of <hi>Africk.</hi> But of theſe <hi>Mahometans</hi> are many ſects alſo, who have their Heads, and Doctours to defend them, for divers have commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the <hi>Alcaron,</hi> not directly allowing of what it preſcribeth, but contradict it in many things; of all which different ſects, and Orders, with their leaders, (ſome of whom differ not onely from the reſt in their law, but alſo in faith) may be ſeen in the book entituled, A deſcription of Eſtates, Empires, and Principalities. But among other differences of the Law and Religion between the Moors of <hi>Fez,</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> this is one, that they ſubmit to the <hi>Califf</hi> of <hi>Bagdet,</hi> and not to him of <hi>Cair,</hi> to whom the <hi>Turks</hi> yield obedience. Here are alſo Jews, who having multiplyed in <hi>Spain,</hi> came by degrees into <hi>Africk;</hi> and afterwards there increaſed, when <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> called the Catholique, and <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> King of <hi>Portugall,</hi> expelled them their Kingdomes; many of whom comming, brought the Trades and Arts of <hi>Europe</hi> with them, which were before unknown unto the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> The Jews pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe much the Art of the Gold-Smith (which is forbidden by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets</hi> law) and eſpecially of Smiths. There are but few called Chriſtians in the Realms of <hi>Fez,</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> beſides ſlaves, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch as live in places poſſeſſed by the <hi>Portugalls</hi>) whoſe ſtate is deſervedly to be pitied; enduring more pain among theſe <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> than beaſts do among us. But <hi>Spain</hi> (moſt of thoſe ſlaves being that Kings ſubject's) hath two Religious Orders, (the one
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:33388:387"/>called <hi>de la Merced,</hi> in <hi>Arragon;</hi> the other much greater, having the name of the <hi>Redemption of Captives</hi>) appointed purpoſely for Redeeming them; who gather great Sums of Money yearly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they free a great number, for they ſend diligent and faithfull men to <hi>Fez, Morocco,</hi> and <hi>Algier,</hi> who firſt redeeming Prieſts and Religious men, then free the other ſort: firſt the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Subject, then the reſt; and there is alwayes one of the Religious of <hi>Spain,</hi> at <hi>Fez,</hi> who informing himſelf of the quality and neceſſity of ſlaves, prepares a way for their delivery the year following. And to conclude of <hi>Barbary;</hi> The great <hi>Turk</hi> hath therein three <hi>Beglerbegs,</hi> or great <hi>Baſsaes,</hi> proudly ſtyled, Lords of Lords; the firſt whereof is at <hi>Tripolis,</hi> (which was taken in by <hi>Sinan Baſsa</hi> from the Knights of <hi>Malta</hi> in 1551) and he commandeth under him 8000 <hi>Timariots,</hi> and 6000 <hi>Janizaries.</hi> The ſecond at <hi>Tunis,</hi> or <hi>Tunneis,</hi> who being of great authority, commandeth under him twelve <hi>Sanzacks,</hi> or Lords, Governours, and 35000 <hi>Timariots.</hi> The third at <hi>Algier,</hi> who hath under him fourteen <hi>Sanzacks,</hi> and 40000 <hi>Timariots.</hi> Theſe are all he hath in <hi>Africk,</hi> except the great <hi>Vizier Baſsa</hi> of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> But in <hi>Aſia,</hi> the Greater and the Leſſe, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands 30 <hi>Beglerbegs</hi> or <hi>Baſsaes.</hi>

                     <p>Next to <hi>Barbary</hi> is <hi>Numidia</hi> (not that ſpoken of ſo much in the <hi>Romane</hi> Hiſtory, for that is a part of <hi>Tunis</hi>); on the North whereof is Mount <hi>Atlas,</hi> ſo high that they ſay its top cannot be ſeen, and was ſo called from <hi>Atlas</hi> a King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> (who being of a great ſtature, was feigned by Poets to bear up Heaven with his ſhoulders; either for his skill in Aſtronomy, or for the great height of the Hill). It is now named <hi>Anchiſae,</hi> or <hi>Montes Clari,</hi> that is, famous mountains, on its South-ſide <hi>Lybia,</hi> and may be called <hi>Numidia,</hi> from the manner of its inhabitants, the <hi>Numidae,</hi> there li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, it being like the <hi>Scythian Nomades:</hi> for theſe are ſaid to ſpend their time in hunting, and to ſtay no longer in one place than there is graſſe for their Camells, ſo that they are a baſe, theeviſh, murderous, and ignorant people; although the <hi>Arabians</hi> who are mixt among them, are more liberall, civill, and ingenuous. The Country is meanly peopled; for <hi>Teffet,</hi> accounted by them a great City, hath in it not above 400 families; nor (if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve reports) have no neighbours within three hundred miles thereof.</p>

                        <hi>LYBIA</hi> (which is <hi>AFRICA,</hi> properly ſo called, and is ſo named either from <hi>Lybs</hi> formerly a Mooriſh King, or from <hi>Lybia</hi> a Queen hereof, or from <hi>Lyns</hi> fignifying the South-Wind, which gently bloweth from theſe parts) is bounded with <hi>Nilus</hi> on the Eaſt, the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean on the Weſt, and is now called <hi>Sarra,</hi> that is, a Deſart; for it is full of vaſt ſandy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts, (being alſo under the torrid Zone, or ſcorching heat of the Sun). In one of theſe Deſarts it was that <hi>William Lithgow,</hi> the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Traveller in King <hi>James</hi> his daies, endured (as he ſaith) both
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:33388:388"/>hunger and great drought, for ſeven or eight dayes, as he went from <hi>Fez</hi> towards <hi>Arracon,</hi> a great Town on the Frontiers of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> with one <hi>Chatteline</hi> a <hi>French</hi> lapidatour, who would go thither to buy Diamonds and pretious ſtones, <hi>Chatteline</hi> on the eighth day, in the night, falling ſick of a burning Feaver, and mindfull to return, <hi>Lithgow</hi> left him at <hi>Ahetzo,</hi> the fartheſt Town Southward of the Kingdome of <hi>Fez,</hi> (well fortified with Walls, and a Garriſon of Moors therein) and with his <hi>Dragoman</hi> Moor, went forward, entring the <hi>Agaroes</hi> Country, whoſe better ſort of inhabitants were half clad, the vulgars naked, who had an <hi>Emeer</hi> or Prince of their own, ſubject to none but his own paſſion;, yet had they a baſtard ſhew of Mahometanicall Religion. They toyled ſix dayes in traverſing this Country, whoſe ſalvages both ſnarled on them, and ſometimes gave them baſtinado's; yea, and enough was it for the <hi>Dragoman</hi> to ſave <hi>Lithgow's</hi> life and liberty from them, who were ſtill inquirous what he was, and whither he went. On the ſeventh day, they came into the ſoil of the <hi>Hagans,</hi> and the <hi>Jamnites,</hi> moſt part whereof were White Moors, ſome of whoſe better ſort, (and chief among them) had their Members covered, but far more wickedly conditioned than the former; who were ruled by a <hi>Xeriff,</hi> having his Guard made up of young <hi>Balars,</hi> or Pages; and Women, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rather to live without any Religion, then to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any Deity. Then were they led by a <hi>Hagan</hi> Guide five dayes together South-Eaſtward, almoſt contrary to the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> whither they were bent: who ſtealing from them on the 6th night; they the next day continuing their faces the ſame way, were long ere night involved in a diſ-inhabited Countrey, being both a vaſte Wilderneſſe, (and a part of the <hi>Berdoan's</hi> Country, one of the four Tribes of the old <hi>Lybians;</hi> the <hi>Sabuncks, Carmines,</hi> and South-<hi>Garolines,</hi> being the other three) and alſo mountainous and dangerous for wild beaſts, whom to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighten, they burnt (every night) ſhrubs of <hi>Tara.</hi> But the day after their firſt entrance herein, they proceeded farther, thinking to find People and Tents to relieve them with victuals, and inform them of the Country; but they found none, nor ſeven dayes after; ſo that their victual and water being done, they relyed on To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, and drank their own piſſe for the time aforeſaid. This ſoyl was covered with hard and ſoft ſands, (and thoſe full of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents) whoſe interlarding rockey hights were faced with Caves and Dens of wild beaſts; whoſe hollow cryes, they both heard in the night, and ſighted them often in the day, eſpecially Jackals, Bears and Boars, and ſometimes Cymbers, Tygers, and Leopards, againſt whom when approaching, they either ſhot off a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebus, or flaſhed ſome powder in the Air. The <hi>Dragoman</hi> (on the 4th day of their ſeven, being there) wondring to ſee him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſuch heat, hunger, and toyl, deſpairing, threatned him with death, to make him ſeek back for their neareſt refuge. So <hi>Lith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow</hi> holding his courſe North-Eaſt, met (early on the 8th day) with
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:33388:388"/>900 Savages, or naked <hi>Lybian</hi> Sabunks, 500 being women, armed with Bowes and Arrowes; who with their complices had put the night before, 300 Berdoans, their neighbour Tribe, to the ſword, and brought away 600 ſheep and goats, beſides other beſtiall. Their Emeere or Prince came in the Rear with 100 horſemen, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving half pikes, ſharply headed at both ends with ſteel; he was cloathed onely with a vail of Crimſon Silk, hanging on his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhoulders with coloured Ribbans, from his breaſts to his mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle thigh, and on his head a party-coloured ſhaſh ſet like a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; both knees being bare, as alſo his anckles; the calves of his leggs were girded with crimſon ſilk, and on his feet were yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſhooes, his face and beard burnt with the Sun, and about the age of 33 years. His Page was even covered like himſelf; but all his followers ſtark naked. He and all the four Tribes of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> worſhip Garlick onely for their God, it being a ſtrong thing, and moſt part of their food; unto which they annex Altars, Prieſts, and ſuperſtitious rites. He gave them both liberty of life, and relief of food; and after an hours parley with them, gave unto <hi>Lithgow</hi> his Bow, and a Quiver of Arrowes. He alſo telling them, that <hi>Tunis</hi> was their beſt and neareſt recourſe, ſent a guide with them for four dayes journey, for 5 Sultans or 35 s. who brought them thorow the moſt habitable and beſt Tented paſſages of the Country: where once a day they found Bread, Water, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, Onions, and ſometimes Hens, which (ſaith he) if truth may have credit, we would Roſt or Scorch dry at the very face of the Sun, and ſo eat them. Their guide on the 5th day left them among 400 Tents of <hi>Numidian</hi> Moors or baſtard <hi>Arabians,</hi> pitched in a pleaſant Valley between two ſources of water, where they repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome 9 dayes; and where likewiſe, he affirmeth to have ſeen Smiths work Nailes and Horſe-ſhooes out of cold iron, ſoftened onely by the vigorous heat of the Sun, and the hard hammering of hands on the Anvile; as alſo he ſaw it in <hi>Aſia.</hi> So renewing their guides from place to place, they deſcended from Savage, to Civil Moors, and arrived ſafely, (though with great difficulty and danger) at <hi>Tunis.</hi> The <hi>Garamantes,</hi> who were thought to be the fartheſt people Southward, lived in this Country: and thoſe called the <hi>Pſylli,</hi> who (if it may be believed) were of ſo venomous a nature, that they could poyſon a Snake. <hi>Herodotus</hi> alſo tells of an Expedition that this people made againſt the South-wind; for that, it (blowing abroad the ſands) had dryed up thoſe ſmall waters among them: but the wind encountring them with a vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of ſand, overwhelmed and ſlew them all. <hi>Arius,</hi> who denyed Chriſt to be one ſubſtance with the Father, was born here. The <hi>Lybians</hi> ſeem rather to be worſe than the <hi>Numidian</hi> Moors: their chief Cities being <hi>Guargata, Toberraum</hi> and <hi>Huaden.</hi> Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that theſe two Nations have neither King nor Laws, but are governed by the chief men of every Tribe; but this agreeth not with our Traveller's relation. And whereas they are ſaid to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:33388:389"/>worſhip a god called <hi>Pſaphon:</hi> who teaching divers birds which he caught, to ſay, <hi>Pſaphon was a Great God,</hi> the ſimple people yielded him divine worſhip: he ſaith, the <hi>Lybians</hi> do all worſhip Garlick: But that they are moſtly groſſe idolatrous Pagans, is plain, and that among ſome of the Naturals, the <hi>Saracens</hi> from <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Barbarie</hi> have planted their <hi>Mahometan</hi> ſuperſtition, we deny not.</p>
                     <p>THe Land of the <hi>NEGROES</hi> (ſo called, either from the River <hi>Niger,</hi> which in Latine ſignifyeth Black; or becauſe its people are of a black colour) is bounded on the North with <hi>Lybia,</hi> on the South with <hi>Congo</hi> or <hi>Manicongo,</hi> a Kingdom in the Lower <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> It containeth 25 Provinces, the chief where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are 11, to wit, <hi>Guala, Guinea, Tombutum, Melli, Cano, Benin, Nubia, Gialofi, Ganaga, Goaga</hi> and <hi>Bornum;</hi> two of whoſe chief Cities are <hi>Tombutum</hi> and <hi>Chovinum,</hi> ſaid to be the third City for eſteem, of all <hi>Africa.</hi> There are four Kingdomes herein, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that of <hi>Tombutum</hi> (whoſe firſt King was <hi>Ichia,</hi> who in 1526, ſlew <hi>Soni Halin</hi> their laſt <hi>Lybian</hi> Lord; for in the year 908, when the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Prieſts came out of zeal into theſe parts, they had neither King nor Common-wealth) is the greateſt, whoſe King is very rich, keeps a Royal Palace, with a very great guard, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes maintaining a great number of learned men, and, they ſay, cauſing all who have any Commerce with the Jews, to be ſlain. That of <hi>Bornum,</hi> which is ſomewhat leſſe; that of <hi>Goaga,</hi> and that of <hi>Gualata,</hi> conſiſting but of that one Province. Theſe people are beſt conceited with their native beauty or black colour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ſaid to paint the Devil white, in diſdain of him. They were ſo blockiſh, that when the <hi>Portugals</hi> firſt ſailed hither, they took their ſhips for great birds with white wings: the painted eyes on the beaks of their ſhips, to be their directours in their courſe; bag-pipes to be living creatures; yea, after they had felt them: and Guns for their hideous noiſe, to be the Devil's works. Both males and females uſe to go naked till they are married, and then to cloath themſelves from the waſte to the knees. What the fruitfulneſſe of theſe Countries are, is hard exactly to know: yet the fields adjacent to the River <hi>Niger,</hi> being 40 dayes (yearly) overflown by the ſaid river, the Country is the more fertile for its inundations; which elſe could be little, through the dryneſſe of the ſoyl, affording no exhalations for clouds to give rain: The Province of <hi>Cano</hi> aboundeth in Lemmons and Pomegranats, and thoſe of <hi>Melli,</hi> (whoſe Country is 300 miles long) are ſaid to be the civilleſt, induſtriouſeſt, and richeſt of all the <hi>Negroes.</hi> And in <hi>Nubia</hi> there is a mortal poyſon, at 100 Duckats the ounce, of which the very 10th part of a grain will end one in a quarter of an hours time. But for pure gold and ſilver, the Country of theſe <hi>Nigrites</hi> is abundantly ſtored. Touching Religion, they are groſſe Idolatrous Pagans; yet with ſome mixture of <hi>Mahometans</hi>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:33388:389"/>jand outward Chriſtians: with which laſt, <hi>Nubia</hi> is reported to have been wholly peopled; but now for want of Miniſters, fallen to the former Paganiſm; for they once ſending to the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Emperour for inſtructers, were unworthily (whatſoever the cauſe was) rejected by him.</p>

Some report theſe <hi>Aethiopians</hi> (as they are black, ſo) ignorant and void of all Learning: But <hi>Eſcala</hi> his learned Book, of <hi>The Correction of Times,</hi> is a witneſſe, they are not ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as ſome hold them to be: yet it appears, they are for the moſt part ſlow and dull of wit: in that having flax, they can make no cloath; having Sugar-canes, and cannot draw it out; iron, and cannot work it; holding Smiths for Sorcerers and wicked men. Yet are they much given to Navigation: ſo that they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:33388:391"/>in the Merchants ſhips of <hi>Goa, Bengala, China,</hi> and other places; ſerving herein for little money, and differing very little from ſlaves, as being ready for all drudgeries, and enduring whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, &amp;c. very patiently. They are kept by their Emperial Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in wonderfull awe, both high and low; who intreats them more like ſlaves then ſubjects, taking away, and giving whole <hi>Siegnuries,</hi> to whom he pleaſeth, none daring to ſhew any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, for he is held by them for a ſacred and divine perſon; (whoſe colour alſo is ſaid to be whiter than the reſt) who was wont to ſhew himſelf but once a year to his ſubjects.

But they ſo honour his name, that hearing thereof, they bend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and touch the ground with their hands, reverencing alſo his Tent, although he be not in it. Theſe Countries have two Summers, and two Winters yearly; not diſtinguiſhed by heat, and cold, but by continuall ſhowers, and fair weather. They are generally very fertile; yielding Barley, Peaſe, Beans, Millet and other Pulſes, though but little Wheat, likewiſe abundance of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, if they knew now to refine it. There are almoſt an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of Oranges, Lemons, and Citrons, and great ſtore of Vines; but no Melons roots, nor Olives, but they make Oyl of a fruit called <hi>Gove.</hi> They have abundance of Honey, and Wax enough to ſerve the Country with Candles, without Tallow. Flax they have, yet not the Art of making Linnen Cloath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; Yet they make it of Cotton, whereof there is abundance. They have almoſt all ſorts of beaſts, and Fowl, as we in <hi>Europe;</hi> as Oxen, Aſſes, Horſes, (though but ſmall) Camells, Sheep; alſo Elephants, Lions, Tigres, Onces, and Stags, but no Bears, nor Conyes, neither is there any Bulfinch. Mines of Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Iron, and Braſſe, are not wanting; which they know not how to draw; Yet in <hi>Zagamedra,</hi> they draw their pure Mines of Silver by fire, making it run like rods; and in <hi>Damat</hi> they draw it, and refine it ſomething better. Their fields are full of Geeſe, Partridges, and Hares, becauſe they never hunt; ſo that their Country is bountifull, if they knew how to uſe ſuch a happineſſe. But there is ſometimes one inconvenience; to wit, multitudes of Graſhoppers, even darkning the Ayre, ſpoiling one Province or another by eating the leaves and barks of Trees, and devouring their Harveſt. Their Prince's revenue ariſeth three wayes; From the Fruits of his demeans, manured by Oxen and Slaves; From his Subjects, who pay him for every fire, and the tenth of all Mineralls which they draw; and from the Princes ſubject unto him; ſome giving him Horſes, others Oxen, Cotton, and other things; So that it is conceived he hath great places full of Gold, pretious ſtones, and Cloath. His Subjects (as to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) are moſt out-ſide Chriſtians; yet are there ſome <hi>Mahometans</hi> alſo, his tributaries; who are alwayes ſeeking to revolt.

But the Flemings and Porrugals ſeeing them get up into Trees, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their haunches, to gather leaves, and ſtooping eaſily down to drink where the water is low, makes it evident, that they have joynts.</p>
                     <p>Here are alſo Tygers, whom the <hi>Congoans</hi> call <hi>Engoi,</hi> who through hunger's ſharpneſſe, finding nought in the field, do fall upon tame Cattle; and as <hi>Loope</hi> teſtifieth, never ſet upon White men, but oft-times the Blacks. The beaſt called <hi>Zabree,</hi> breeds in this Province; and is like a mule, but it ingenders and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes greatly, having young every year: whoſe hair having from the ridge of the back to the belly ſtreaks of white, black and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, is very ſtrange; they are exceeding ſwift, and wild; whom if the Inhabitants had art to tame, might ſerve inſtead of horſes which this Country wants: whoſe office notwithſtanding men do perform by carrying them, who ſpeedily journey, in litters or chairs, the bearers being often changed. Beaſts called <hi>Empalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> ſome as big as an Ox, others leſſe, are here alſo. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, they have wild Bugles or Oxen, Wolves ſmelling afar off, Foxes, Goats, Stags, Hares, and Conies in abundance; for they hunt them not to death, as in <hi>Europe.</hi> They have many Civit-Cats, whom they keep tame for their pleaſing ſent. There are divers kinds of Serpents and Vipers, ſome being 25 foot long, 5 broad, with a very large belly and throat, that (if we can credit it) will devour a beaſt as big as a Stag. They kill them ſleeping, and hold the food of their fleſh better than of any fowl. But ſome Vipers are ſo poyſonſome, that any one bitten dyes within 25 hours. There is likewiſe a ſtrange beaſt as big as a ram, with wings like a Dragon, a tail, long beak, many rowes of teeth, two leggs,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:33388:393"/>whoſe skin is red, mixt with green and blew, and who eat raw fleſh. It hath Camelions, Parrots green and grey; very fair red birds, and many ſorts of ſmall ones ſinging like Canarie-birds: finally, great ſtore of Hens, Ducks, Geeſe, Turkies, Peacocks, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges wild and tame, Turtles, Pigeons, Faulcons, Sparrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks, Eagles, and Pelicans. The Province of <hi>Congo</hi> hath many Elephants, and divers ſorts of imitating Apes, many Kine, with divers beaſts forementioned: alſo ſtore of Cryſtal and other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; but preferring Iron, which is found in the aforeſaid fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Mountain; whoſe water is excellent good, not hurting any one: which is ſtored with graſſe, much Cattle, Fruit-Trees al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way green, yielding all kind of grain, chiefly that called <hi>Luco,</hi> whoſe bread is as good as ours; abundance of white Millet call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mazze; alſo Meaz or Turky Wheat, and ſtore of Rice; but they little eſteem theſe. <hi>Bananes,</hi> which ſome take to be <hi>Muſe;</hi> and others, <hi>Indian</hi> Figs, a pleaſing and good food grow here; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Limons and Citrons exceeding pleaſant, whereof the poor live. There are three ſorts of Palm-Trees: from one whereof they draw Oyl, Wine-Vinegar, Fruit, and Bread. Other Trees bear a Fruit called Cola, as big as a Pine-apple: and other wild Palms, whoſe fruit are good to eat, and with whoſe leaves they cover their Cottages, and make baskets, &amp;c. This Province hath abundance of Melons and Cucumbers; alſo Tamarinds and Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, which ſerve both the Moors and Turks for Phyſick. The River <hi>Leonde</hi> ingenders Crocodiles, and the Hog-fiſh, ſo big and fat, that ſome weigh 500 weight and more: alſo Sea-horſes, or the River-horſe, which is tawny, having little hair, leaping to land, and feeding, and by day living in the river; ſome of whom the <hi>Africans</hi> do tame: and they are exceeding ſwift, but they muſt not paſſe over deep rivers, becauſe they will preſently dive. But this river which runs at the foot of the Mountain where the royal Town of <hi>Congo</hi> is built, ſo dries up when the rain ceaſeth, that one may eaſily wade it. On the ſhoar of whoſe Iſland <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onde,</hi> are found gray Cockles very gliſtering, and better eſteemed than thoſe on the other ſhoars: where alſo is a Tree called <hi>Enſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> alwayes green, and, having many virtues, ſtrangely multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to wit, by ſome ſmall threds hanging down from the high branches, and rooting in the ground; whoſe upper bark being made clean, is a kind of linnen cloath, making garm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here are likewiſe big Oyſters, which they call <hi>Ambizimitare,</hi> that is, fiſh of a ſtone. They find here alſo divers fiſhes, as Pilchards, Soles, Crafiſhes, &amp;c. And about the outward part of this Iſland are many black Whales; who fighting, many die: whoſe fat being taken and mixt with Pitch, the Inhabitants calk their ſhips. Moreover, we muſt not forget the great ſtore of ſtone, and goodly Marble Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, beſides the Jaſper and Porphyrie, with the white Marble,

So that, if we look on the abundance of metals in this Realm, as alſo their Elephants, and Civit-Cats, wherewith they abound, Sea-cockles ſerving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of coyn, traffique of Slaves, linnen cloath of <hi>Songo,</hi> and <hi>Sunde</hi> made of <hi>Indian</hi> Palm-Trees, Cryſtal, though not altogether ſo profitable; we may ſoon ſee how they are ſought to by forreign Merchants, whereby their wealth may be conjectured. And as for the King, none would doubt, but that he (having all theſe Countries under him) is exceeding rich: of whom, one thing is reported to his commendation, That he doth Juſtice publiquely, without any formality; for that all things are debated before him in few words. As to their religious belief, they are ſo full of vanities, that they ſcarce know what they believe: for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though an outward profeſſion of Chriſtianity be crept into this Realm, yet is it full of groſſe Idolaters: ſome worſhipping the Sun as Husband to the Moon; and the Moon as his Wife in the ſecond place.

Some repreſent alſo, the manners of this people to be as ill-favoured as their bodies, and faces; for being cole-black, with thick Lips, and flat Noſes, they likewiſe live like beaſts. The long Southern Promontory called <hi>The Cape of Good Hope,</hi> (whoſe top hath a fair Plain covered with Graſſe and various flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, named the Table of the <hi>Cape,</hi> and largely overlooking the Sea on all ſides; which here being very rough and tempeſtuous, hath often vexed the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) is of this Region, and was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Vaſco di Games</hi> in 1497.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, before we ſpeak of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> we will look over the <hi>African</hi> Iſlands, which are thoſe in the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, or in the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Sea. In the former are to be noted. 1. That called the Princes Iſland, ſeated between the <hi>Aequator,</hi> and <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn,</hi> and ſo named, becauſe the Prince of <hi>Portugall</hi> was to have its Revenues when his <hi>Portugalls</hi> had conquered it. Nigh this, is that called the Iſle of Saint <hi>Helen,</hi> which they ſo named from their Saint <hi>Helen,</hi> on whoſe day it was diſcovered, and over which (as the other) the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do command. 2. The <hi>Gorgades,</hi> of old the <hi>Gorgons,</hi> they are nine in number, now called the Iſlands of the <hi>Green Cape,</hi> for that they lye near the ſaid <hi>Cape,</hi> in the <hi>Negroes</hi> Land. <hi>James</hi> Iſland is the chief of theſe, whoſe principall Town is <hi>Ribiera,</hi> fortyfied by the <hi>Spaniards.

Goats are the chief thing theſe Iſlands abound with. 3. The <hi>Canaries,</hi> of which before in <hi>Spain,</hi> which for their fruitfullneſſe, &amp;c. were of old called the <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>-Iſlands. But the <hi>Canaries,</hi> from the chiefeſt Iſle <hi>Canaria,</hi> or from the Dogs, in which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> found them to abound: They are accounted by ſome, but ſeven in number; three where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to wit, the Iſle <hi>Canarie, Palma,</hi> (where ſhips uſe to touch going to <hi>America</hi>) and <hi>Tenariff,</hi> 90 miles in circuit, are the chief; in which <hi>Tenariff,</hi> neither ſhowr nor river is ſaid to be; but their water is conveyed into divers parts from a high Mountain, having a Tree alway covered with a moyſt cloud, which every noon-tide diſſolveth.

Although the Flemings firſt diſcovered theſe Iſlands, and thence were called the Flemiſh Iſlands; yet the Portugals ſubdued them all under Prince <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Conduct in 1444. <hi>Tercera</hi> it ſelf hath been called by us the Iſland <hi>Oade,</hi> becauſe it aboundeth in Oade.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The <hi>Heſperides, Happy</hi> Iſlands, whereof Poets making fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent mention, placed here the Elyzian fields.

Their chief Town or City is of the ſame name. It is called St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> which name I ſuppoſe the Portugals gave it, when they diſcovered it in 1506. The people are but of a dusky colour. It is (by relation) a goodly Countrey, abounding with beaſts both wild and tame, and all kinds of fruits; alſo Ginger, Cloves, and likewiſe with Silver. It hath both fair Rivers, and ſafe Harbours; yet they would neither trade, nor be traded with by others; yet the <hi>Portugals</hi> have gained a little traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique with them, whom yet they ſuffer not to come on ſhoar. Theſe people keep to one Wife; but for other things, ſaid to be inhoſpitable and treacherous, and not onely ignorant of prayer, but of years, moneths, yea and weekly dayes diſtinction.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Zocotara,</hi> which is 60 miles long, 24 broad, and is ſcituated at the very mouth of the red-Sea. Its chief City is ſo called where the King reſides. This Iſland, through much winds and dryneſſe, is deficient in moſt neceſſaries for life; yet hath it plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Phyſicall Drugs, eſpecially of Aloes; called (if true) <hi>Zaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trina</hi> (not <hi>Succotrina</hi>) from this place.

                     <p n="3">3. The Iſle of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſeated juſt under the Aequinoctial, and of a roundiſh figure. It's 180 miles about; the principal Town being <hi>Pavoaſan.</hi> At its firſt diſcovery, the <hi>Portugals</hi> found it a Wood; who with the Negroes now dwell there.

Aegypt</hi> being firſt inhabited by <hi>Miſraim</hi> the ſon of <hi>Chus,</hi> was called by the Hebrews <hi>Miſreia,</hi> and the <hi>Arabians</hi> are ſaid now to call it <hi>Miſre.</hi> It hath had divers names not very material here to repeat; But it was named Egypt, either from the river <hi>Nilus,</hi> once called Aegypt; or from the people deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Chams</hi> race, who, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith, were called <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> or from one of their Kings ſurnamed <hi>Aegyptus,</hi> and named <hi>Rameſes,</hi> the brother of <hi>Danaus.</hi> It was (of old) divided into high and low, (though others have divided it into High, Middle, and Low). High <hi>Aegypt</hi> being long and ſtrait, beginning at the Cataracts beyond <hi>Siena,</hi> on <hi>Aethiopia's</hi> Frontiers, and ending near <hi>Cair.</hi> Low <hi>Aegypt</hi> containing that which hath the form of an Iſland made by the two Channels of <hi>Nile</hi> and the Sea, extending from <hi>Caire</hi> unto the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,</hi> Northward, and is as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith, about 3000 ſtades in Circuit, that is 375 <hi>Italian</hi> Miles, and was named [<hi>Delta</hi>] from its triangular form, or reſemblance to the <hi>Greek</hi> letter ſo called. It's ſcituation is near the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Cancer,</hi> bending towards the Northern or Artick Circle, betwixt the ſeventh and tenth Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell, eſpecially under the ſecond climate, whereby the longeſt day is thirteen hours and an half, nor in moſt Northern parts above fourteen. Some have affirmed there were two thonſand Cities and Towns, others 1020, in this Country; But <hi>Ortelius</hi> who was dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the ſearch, found but 300. yet the Wars with <hi>Aethiopia, Syria,</hi> and the <hi>Romanes,</hi> might ruine many Towns therein; But we
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:33388:396"/>will mention onely ſome of the chief of them; as 1. <hi>Siena,</hi> now called <hi>Aſne,</hi> the moſt Southern City thereof, and ſaid to be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the Tropick of <hi>Cancer;</hi> for <hi>Ptolemy</hi> ſaith, they making a very great pit, there was no ſhadow of the Sun, when he entred into <hi>Cancer.</hi> 2. <hi>Memphis</hi> ſcituated beyond <hi>Nile</hi> Weſtward, where the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Princes reſided; in whoſe place <hi>Caire</hi> ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and was the aboad of the <hi>Sultans. Caire</hi> is a great City, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> about 240 of our miles, which a traveller thither, calls (for its admirableneſſe and greatneſſe) the little World, being, (ſaith he) thrice as large as <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and as populous, though not ſo well builded, being ſcituate in a pleaſant plain, and in the heart of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> kiſſing <hi>Nilus</hi> at ſome parts. It's divided into five parts. 1. New-<hi>Cair,</hi> the principall of the other, and lying in the midſt of them, and contains all the chief Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe and Market-places, it hath walls and Ports, and is in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit twenty two miles. 2. Old <hi>Caire,</hi> where <hi>Memphis</hi> antiently ſo called, ſtood, alſo named <hi>Babylon</hi> of the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> This was the fartheſt place <hi>Ulyſses</hi> viſited in his travells, which <hi>Homer</hi> ſo memorizeth, yet (ſaith <hi>Lithgow</hi>) they were not anſwerable to the fifth part of mine. 3. <hi>Medin,</hi> which joyns to the back ſide of Old <hi>Caire,</hi> towards the <hi>Piramides</hi> (which are not far from hence) 4. <hi>Boulake</hi> running a great length along the River ſide; which hath three Market places of no ſmall account. 5. <hi>Caraffar,</hi> a great Town bending Southward in the way of the Red-Sea, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miles. All which four, are (ſaith he) but as Suburbs to the New <hi>Caire,</hi> making up a Country rather than a City, yet all touch one with another either to the right or left hand, or to both, with a multitude of ſtreets: whoſe length in all, from the loweſt end of <hi>Boulake,</hi> to the Southmoſt part of <hi>Caraffar,</hi> is 28 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles, and 14 in breadth; for tryall whereof, he ſaith, he trod it one day on foot from Sun to Sun, being guided and guarded by a riding <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zary,</hi> which, for his bruiſed feet on the ſtreets, was one of the ſoreſt dayes journey that ever he had in his life. Here are three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall gates in New <hi>Caire; Babeh Mamſtek,</hi> looking towards the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, and Red-Sea; <hi>Bebzavillah</hi> towards <hi>Nilus;</hi> and <hi>Babell Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuch,</hi> toward the fields. The ſtreets are narrow, and all almoſt covered to ſave them from the parching heat, with open vents for light, and their buildings are commonly two ſtories high, made either of mud or brick, and plat-forms on the tops, whereon they ſleep uſually in the night, to receive the freſh and cooling Ayre. Here is a great Pallace where the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> or <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Vice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conſtantly reſides, and on a moderate height, from whence a ſull proſpect of the better part of the Town, Gardens and Villages, bordering on <hi>Nile,</hi> with a great part of the lower plains of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> may be taken. There is likewiſe ſaid to be in this City, a Tower, whereby (by obſerving how high <hi>Nile</hi> riſeth, for there are divers marks in it by which they judg) they know how fruitful it will be every year in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> for if the River ſwell unto the higheſt hole of the Tower, they have abundance of Corn. Another ſaith it was in a

It is divided into Old and New, and is ſeated in a ſandy Country on the Sea ſhore, more broad than long, and like a half Moon: The Old is three miles long, having within it (beſides other rare things) two Mountains of incloſed ſand. The antient Walls are yet ſtanding, but little inhabited within; four things more, among others, are here eminent; the Ciſterns bringing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from an Arme of <hi>Nile</hi> called <hi>Calis,</hi> and ſupported by Marble Pillars; two Spires near the Walls of the Port almoſt alike, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with <hi>Hierogliphycall</hi> letters, one whereof lyeth along, almoſt covered with earth; the other ſtanding ten fadome high without the ground, and is eleven foot ſquare: A little above which, is the place as by the ruines doth appear, where <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> Pallace of old ſtood, where ſhe had a Gallery advanced over the Sea; and laſtly, without the Town ſtands a Pillar which <hi>Caeſar</hi> erected in memory of <hi>Pompey</hi> his defeat; it is of Marble, eighty foot high, and twenty in Circuit. The New is ſeated ſomewhat more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, on the right hand of the Old Port, which hath a Caſtle of the Old Town for defence, but (through difficulty) they uſe it onely ſometimes to lodge their Foiſts and Galleys. The New Port is on its right hand, and is but an open road ſubject to the Northern Winds, but defended by two Caſtles (on both ſides) called <hi>Farilos</hi> one ſtanding on a little Peninſula; the other right againſt it; ſo that all Ships muſt needs paſſe within ſhot of theſe Caſtles; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which two Ports (through the Ayres bandneſſe) the very Town (it is judged) would be ſoon abandoned. Two things are remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable of this City. That the people were ſo licentious, that they would neither ſpare perſonally and verbally to abuſe their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour; nor <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours, their Lords themſelves: for which cauſe <hi>Caracalla</hi> comming to the City, and impatient of the ſame, aſſembled the youths of the City, as if to chooſe ſome for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on his perſon, and ſuddenly commanded his ſouldiers to put them all to the Sword; and that, one <hi>Gautenus</hi> reading Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Philoſophy in this Town in 180. thence it is thought the ſetting up Univerſities firſt began in <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> Right againſt <hi>Alexandria</hi> they place the little Iſle <hi>Pharos,</hi> in <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Ptolemies</hi> time, but now it joyns to the Continent; and whoſe <hi>Pharus</hi> or watch-Tower (built by <hi>Ptolemy Philadelphus</hi> for benefit of Sailers, too tedious here particularly to deſcribe) was accounted one of the Worlds ſeven Wonders. The <hi>Mauſolaeum,</hi> which ſignifies a Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre or Monument for the dead: <hi>Babylon,</hi> not of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but that

It was called by <hi>Oppius,</hi> one of <hi>Aegypts</hi> two Cloyſters, or doors to ſhut it up, to wit by Sea; the other by land, being <hi>Peluſium.</hi> This ſeems to me to be the ſame which the Deſcriber of <hi>Eſtates and Principalities,</hi> &amp;c. calls the Caſtle, which (ſaith he) is very incommodious, in that they muſt carry water thither from <hi>Alexandria's</hi> Ciſterns, upon Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mells backs. 4. <hi>Peluſium,</hi> now called <hi>Damiata,</hi> and ſeated near the Mediterranean Sea, it was alſo named <hi>Eliopolis,</hi> of the Prince <hi>Ely,</hi> or <hi>Aly,</hi> who had environed it with three VValls; (but one thinks it to be that now called <hi>Teneze</hi>) This key of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> (as <hi>Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> calls it) was more then once beſieged by Chriſtian Armies, in the time of that called the <hi>Holy War;</hi> The moſt remarkable where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was the eighteen Moneths ſiege of <hi>John de Brenne</hi> (the entituled King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) with the <hi>European</hi> Princes in 1220, concerning the mortality of whoſe beſieged, through raging Plague and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and the unexpected ſeizure thereof, (by two ventrous ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſcaling the Walls, as admiring the peoples ſilence) ye may read at large in the Turkiſh Hiſtory. Beſides theſe Cities, are two others, ſaid to be almoſt as big as <hi>Caire;</hi> alſo <hi>Thebes,</hi> which the Tyrant <hi>Buſiris</hi> builded, 17 miles in compaſſe, and having a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Gates; <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> or the City of Crocodiles; now <hi>Sues,</hi> and almoſt abandoned, though in the <hi>Ptolemies</hi> time, a Haven Town of great commerce; yet the Turks building their Galleys at <hi>Caire,</hi> bring them, when taken in pieces, on Camells backs.

The Country is low, plain, and not mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous; wherefore they have built their Villages (though far from <hi>Nile</hi>) in high places, to avoid <hi>Nilus</hi> his overflowing, which makes Egypt exceeding fruitful; and for want whereof, the dearth is very great; (for they have no rain, as is read in <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. v. 18; or if they chance to have any, it is ſaid to turn to divers inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, as ſores, &amp;c.) it beginning to ſwell about June 17, and continuing 40 dayes, (and falling the like time) which is ſaid to happen when <hi>Aethiopia</hi> hath moſt rain, eſpecially in the farther Mountains. The Greek letters of this river's name containing in them, all the dayes of the year; (for Ν ſtands for 50, Ε for 5, Ι for 10, Λ for 30, Ο for 70, Σ for 200, which make 365,) and the manner of whoſe inundation <hi>Lithgow</hi> undertakes to ſhew, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaith many learned men are meerly miſtaken about its flowing. He ſaith, there is a dry pond digged near the river's brink, called <hi>Machaſh,</hi> wherein ſtands a pillar as high as this ditch is deep, that is, 18 cubits: whereby they know the river's increaſing (and ſo the plenty or ſcarcity of things the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) after this manner: between the river and this pond are ſix
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:33388:399"/>paſſages digged thorow the bank, where when the river begins to ſwell, it falls down thorow the loweſt paſſage into the pond; (and then come forth certain Prieſts cal'd <hi>Darviſhes,</hi> accompanied with 100 Janizaries, pitching their Tents about this Quadrangled pit. In all which time of the inundation, they make great feaſting, rare ſolemnties, with dancing, ſinging, touching of Kettle-Drums, ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Trumpets, and other oſtentations of joy. As the water grows in the river, ſo alſo (now) upon the Pillar, which is marked from bottom to top, with Braſes, handfuls, a foot, a ſpan, and an inch. If the water riſe but to 10 braſes, it prefageth, there will be great dearth, Peſtilence and famine: If to 12 Cubits, the year will be indifferent: if to 15 Braſes, then plenty and abundance: if to 18, then the whole Country is in danger to be drowned and deſtroyed. Alſo, from the body of <hi>Nile,</hi> there are (ſaith he) about 3000 channels drawn thorow the plain, on which paſſing Ditches are all the Boroughs and Towns builded; and through which channels, the river ſpreads it ſelf throughout all the Kingdome: which when ſcowred of filth and Worms, and the water become clear, every houſe opening their Ciſtern window, receiveth as much water as will ſuffice them till the next inundation: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth ever the River flow any where above the banks; for if it ſhould, it would overwhelm the whole Kingdom. All which Channels here or there, do make intercourſe for their ſtreams again, to the body and branches of <hi>Nilus;</hi> ſo that he calls them S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:33388:400"/>and <hi>Roſetta;</hi> yet when it overflowes, many brooks (or channels, into which it is divided) are Navigable. There are abundance of venomous creatures bred (alſo) in this river, as Crocodiles, Scorpions, Water-Snakes, grievous miſhapen worms, and other monſtrous things, who do oft annoy the Inhabitants, and thoſe who traffique on the water, yet it breeds likewiſe very excellent fiſh, and is wonderful fruitfull therein. It is alſo reported to be almoſt 3000 miles long, and ſaid to have its beginning under the Aequinoctial line from the Mountains of the Moon; but more truly from the <hi>Zembrian</hi> Lake in the more inward <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and in a place of the outward <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Alps called <hi>Catadupa. Nile's</hi> water is ſaid to be marvellous ſweet above all others, the cauſe whereof is the extream force of the Sun beating alwayes on it, and making it the lighter, purer, and ſimpler; as alſo his long courſe arrouſing ſo many ſoiles. <hi>Egypt</hi> is not ſubject to Earthquakes, and is ſo fertile for all neceſſaries for man's life, that ſome Antients have called it, <hi>The Store-houſe of the Earth.</hi> It was likewiſe called when the Romans had it, <hi>Horreum Romanum,</hi> or the Roman Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerieor Barn. It abounds with all ſorts of grain and pulſes, good paſtures, and abundance of Olive-Trees, and with herbs good to eat, that they may the more eaſily forbear Corn; there is alſo in the Weſtern part of Lower Egypt ſtore of Cotton and Sugar. Some report, there is very good Wine in divers places, keeping very long, as near the Lake <hi>Meotides.</hi> But another ſaith, it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth no Wines; for theſe Mahometanical Moors obſerving ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the law of their Alcoran, will neither plant, nor ſuffer Vines to be planted, accounting it a deadly ſin to drink Wine: But for Coffa, and Sherpe, which are compoſed Liquors, he ſaith, they drink enough. Palm-trees alſo wonderful high, do grow through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Egypt; 20 great Trees, having been ſaid to be ſeen coming out of one body. Their gardens are repleniſhed with Siccamores, Caſſia, Pomegranates, Oranges and Tamaris, the greateſt part whereof are exceeding high, and the Siccamores exceeding green. The garden of their <hi>Balſamo</hi> lyeth near the South ſide of <hi>Caire,</hi> ſix miles in compaſſe; the Tree being but of three foot high, alwayes green of colour, with a broad three-pointed leaf; and being cut into the body, and branches thrice a year, it yields a red water dropping into earthen veſſels, which is the natural Balſom: Not far from which Garden in a ſandy Deſart, is the place called <hi>Mommeis:</hi> which are a multitude of Caves cut out of a Rock, wherein moſt mens Corpſes of <hi>Caire</hi> are interred: which remain alwayes unputrified, nor yielding a ſtinking ſmell: experiments whereof are, by Merchants bringing whole bodies hands, &amp;c. from thence, which makes the Apothecarie's Mummia, whoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is very black, and the fleſh clung to the bones. Here is a ſhrub called <hi>Alcana,</hi> whoſe leaves being yellow when dryed, the women in the Turk's Country die their hands and feet, with a part of their hair. There is great ſtore of ſmelling flowrs; yet <hi>Plinie</hi> affirms, they do not commonly ſmell very well, through the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:33388:400"/>foggineſſe of the ayr, fromthe river <hi>Nile.</hi> Beſides hurtful beaſts, it breeds alſo a great number of tame cattel, as Bugles, Oxen, Camels, Horſes, Aſſes, Goats, and Sheep: all which grow very great; but the ſheep are exceeding great and fat, whoſe Wooll is black, and their thick tails hanging unto the ground.</p>
                     <p>Here are many Fowl (for <hi>Aegypt</hi> is very Mooriſh in VVinter) eſpecially Storks; wherewith in ſome places the fields are even covered: and who devour the abundance of Frogs which are here bred. There are alſo many Camelions found among the ſhrubs, which (ſaith the Author) live not of the wind as many have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; yet will they continue a whole year without eating any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance. Hens (are ſaid) not to hatch their Chickens here; but they do it by the heat of Furnaces. <hi>Aegypt</hi> hath alwayes aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Mettalls, chiefly near <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> there is likewiſe the <hi>Amethyſt</hi> with many other pretious ſtones, and ſuch ſtore of Aetites or the Eagle-ſtone is found near to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that they load whole ſhips therewith. Their VVomen are very fruitful, having many times three or four children at a birth; neither, as it hath been obſerved, are the eight-Moneths Children in danger of death as in other places. There are alſo Lemons, Citrons, Cherries, Figs, and other fruits, as in our Countries. <hi>Cyrene,</hi> or <hi>Arabia Troglodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> is ſick of <hi>Numidia,</hi> and <hi>Lybia's</hi> diſeaſe, being barren, both of fruits, and water, Sandy, Deſart, and little inhabited, for when <hi>Alexander</hi> travelled to the Oracle of <hi>Jupiter Hammon,</hi> he ſaw nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Man, Beaſt, Bird, Tree, nor River. And as for <hi>Suez,</hi> there is no water within two miles about it; but two miles diſtant they dig it out of a pit, it being ſaltiſh and bitteriſh, and brought upon Camells backs. There is great commerce in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and at <hi>Caire,</hi> with very many Nations; for the Country abounds ſo, as to ſell Silks, Corns, Fruits, VVax, Honey, and the Soveraign Balſome, beſides many other commodities of Cotton-wool, Cloath of Gold and Silver: and the beſt Sattins, Damask, Taffaties, and Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grains that are, are here made. Their King's revenues in the <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemies</hi> time were 12000 Talents.

                     <p>We have briefly viewed the <hi>Old World,</hi> (ſo called) let us alſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the New; New I ſay, not according to the nature of things, but in reſpect of men's skillfullneſſe in diſcovery. That part of the Earth is called the New world, which almoſt by a middle ſpace, is extended between the ſhoars of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and the utmoſt part of <hi>India</hi> from the North thorough the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, waſhing on it on both ſides, under the form of two <hi>Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulaes,</hi> which <hi>Peninſulaes</hi> or almoſt Iſlands, are conjoyned by a ſlender <hi>Isthmus,</hi> or tract of land, in ſuch a manner, that in what part it lyeth under the Aequator, or is not ſo far from it, it is made narrow. Thence it is again dilated, untill (the figure of a <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mide</hi> or <hi>Spire</hi> being ſtretched forth into the South) it contains the <hi>Magellanick</hi> Strait, or Narrow Sea, with other parts yet unknown. And although this continent, be not as yet altogether ſearched out, yet from thoſe parts which are already known, it may eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that this part of the World is greater than the other parts. They ſail about it at this day, beſide that utmoſt tract, which looks to the North. Of this new World are alſo two queſtions raiſed; firſt, Whether it were known to the Antients, or not? But <hi>Keckerman</hi> repeating the probable arguments on both ſides, rather gives his judgment on the affirmative. Secondly, Whether it cleave to <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> or whether it be an Iſland ſeparated from them both? <hi>Chynaeus</hi> ſaith, it is not certain whether it be an Iſland or a Continent; <hi>Friſius</hi> leaves it in doubt: Yet out of the Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Paulus Venetus,</hi> he ſaith, it may probably be drawn that it is an Iſland. Moſt Geographers vote it to be an Iſland. But then whereas another difficult queſtion ariſeth from this, being granted, to wit, Seeing men were in the beginning created in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures alſo, were put into <hi>Aſia</hi> out of <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, how
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:33388:401"/>ſhould both men and other living creatures come into this New World? One <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Coſta</hi> diſputes thereof in the twentieth Chapter of his firſt book of the New VVorld; But this I ſay, that men loſe pretious time in diſputing, and not believing; and alſo that if this be now an Iſland, yet, it might not from the beginning be ſo, for it both ſeems to Croſſe the very Hiſtory of the Creation, and alſo we know, that many Iſlands have in length of time been made by the waſhing of the Sea. But why doth any raiſe a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all from a thing that is not in it ſelf certainly known? And as for the Weſt ſide of <hi>America,</hi> if it (ſaith one) be not a continent with <hi>Tartary,</hi> it is yet disjoyned by a very ſmall ſtraight, as may be perceived in all our Maps and Cards, as alſo in the Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Countries; ſo that there is into them a very quick and eaſy paſſage. Two things alſo are obſerved in the diſcovery hereof, that it was diſcovered about the very ſame time wherein Arts and Tongues began to flouriſh in <hi>Europe,</hi> and alſo ſome Doctrines of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church to be purged from their groſſe droſſineſſe; and that this New VVorld doth in many things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, and in many things alſo hurt the Old VVorld, for from the time that it was found, both all things were dearer in the Old, and alſo greater allurements were afforded unto men, of Luxury and covetouſneſſe, but this latter muſt be imputed unto Man's Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. The time of its firſt deſcrying was by <hi>Chriſtopher Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus,</hi> (born at <hi>Nervi</hi> in <hi>Genoa</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi>) in one thouſand four hundred ninety two, who conſidering the Suns motion, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, there was another VVorld, which the Sun gave light unto, after its departure from us, and being rejected by the <hi>Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,</hi> to whom he firſt opened his intent in 1486. he ſent his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to motion the buſineſſe to our <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, who being taken and deteined over long by Pirats, <hi>Columbus</hi> made his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires known to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court, where, at length being furniſhed with two Ships onely, he is ſaid to have ſailed on the Ocean above ſixty dayes, and could deſcry no land; ſo that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, as deſirous to return, began to mutiny. The <hi>Italian</hi> wary, perceiving the Clouds ſomewhat clearer than before, thought ſome inhabited place was nigh. VVherefore, ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their return for three dayes longer; at the end of them, one deſcryed fire, and ſtraightway after an apparent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was diſcerned: which being an Iſland, <hi>Columbus</hi> in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> named <hi>HISPANIOLA,</hi> but the Natives called it <hi>HAITIE.</hi> Then diſcovering <hi>CABA</hi> alſo, he returned toward <hi>SPAIN,</hi> and after two eminent Navigations more, he died, and was buried at <hi>SEVILL,</hi> in <hi>SPAIN.</hi> But it is divided into <hi>AMERICA,</hi> and <hi>MAGELLANICA;</hi> the former being denominated from <hi>Americus Veſputius,</hi> who followed <hi>Columbus</hi> afterwards in theſe attempts, and whoſe ſhores have their Bounds and Borders (from the Eaſt indeed, whereas it looks towards <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>) the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean; from the Weſt, <hi>Mare</hi> or the Sea <hi>Del Zur;</hi>

It was ſubdued by <hi>Ferdinand Cortez</hi> in 1518; and contains four noted Regions: 1. <hi>Gallicia Nova</hi> (called formerly by the Inhabitants, <hi>Xaliſque</hi>) and where <hi>Nugno de Guſman</hi> built divers Cities; after that, by taking the City <hi>Xaliſco,</hi> he had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all the Province: which being watered by the River of <hi>Piaſtle;</hi> that part which is encloſed by theſe rivers and S. <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> is named <hi>Couliacan,</hi> whoſe chief City or Town being <hi>Couliacan:</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> planting a Colonie there, it is called S. <hi>Michael:</hi> then coming to the red Sea, or of <hi>California</hi> by <hi>Sibole</hi> and <hi>Grenado,</hi> hitherto the <hi>Spaniards</hi> trade, and the Country is inhabited. One <hi>Francis Coronado</hi> came to <hi>Sibole</hi> in 1579, but returned with his Souldiers to <hi>Mexico,</hi> as finding little profit. This Province is moſtly rough and ſtonie; yet there is that, fit to bear of all fruits; and they do catch much fiſh in the Sea, having alſo many wild beaſts in their Forreſts: thoſe on the Sea-ſhoar living of the one; and the inland Savages, on fleſh, taken by hunting. Some ſay likewiſe, they do ſometimes eat mans fleſh. They go for the moſt partnaked, and acknowledging no Ruler, till the <hi>Spaniards</hi> brought them under Dominion. 2. <hi>Mechouachan</hi> or <hi>Mechuacan</hi> about 50 leagues from the Province of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and having 240 miles in compaſſe, three of whoſe chief Towns are <hi>Sinſonſe,</hi> large and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, where their Kings made their abode. <hi>Paſcuar,</hi> where the Biſhop (that is, I ſuppoſe, of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) firſt remained; and <hi>Valadolit</hi> or <hi>Valladolid,</hi> where he is now ſaid to make his reſidence.

It's ſeated in a great Plain about 7 miles in circuit, and encompaſſed with high Mountains, on which is Snow continually. There are alſo in the Plain two Lakes, one freſh, the other ſalt; on the banks whereof, not onely is <hi>Mexico,</hi> but there were almoſt 50 good Towns, <hi>Teſcuto,</hi> yielding little to <hi>Mexico:</hi> and on the bank of <hi>Mexico's</hi> Lake, which is 50 miles about, ſtand pleaſant Towns, and divers houſes, 50000 Wherries being ſtill (they ſay) plying in the Lake. This City is ſix miles in compaſſe, and is the ſeat of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Viceroy, and of an Arch-biſhop; They having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both a Mint, Printing, and an Univerſity. Moreover there is <hi>Anges,</hi> a Town with a very fertile ſoil; <hi>Tulle, Tuluca, Tavaſco,</hi> a great Town, yet the houſes ſtand ſcattering for fear of fire; which had, ſay ſome, 25000 houſes, of Lime, and fat Earth, <hi>Zempoloan,</hi> that is called the true; <hi>Croſse</hi> by which places runs the River <hi>Alua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rada,</hi> and entring into the Sea by three mouths.

The Gulf of <hi>Mexico</hi> is nigh the City ſo called, 900 miles about, of a heady and ſwift current, that ſhips cannot paſſe directly; and hath two Ports, one between the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt part of <hi>Jucatan,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Cuba,</hi> where the Tide violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entreth, the other betwixt <hi>Cuba,</hi> and the utmoſt point of <hi>Florida,</hi> where it forcibly goeth forth. The Sea hath but onely two ſafe Ports, <hi>Havana,</hi> on the North, <hi>John de Lua</hi> on the South, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have ſtrongly fortified; for the Seas are very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous. The <hi>Mexicans</hi> are full of courage, alſo induſtrious, and witty, ſober, and given to traffick; feeding many Silk-Worms, and making many toyes of wood and feathers. The Country is likewiſe exceeding temperate, having many Mulberry Trees; and do now feed many Horſes, Aſſes, and Flocks of Sheep, having alſo ſome Mines. And victualls there doth ſo abound, that 28 pound of Beef is worth but three pence, and a Hog one ſhilling, or 1 <abbr>s.</abbr> &amp; 6 <abbr>d.</abbr> Out of the freſh Lake, they draw an herb, cut every Moon, and worth to the Inhabitants 20000 Crowns yearly.

Finally, if <hi>Peru</hi> (ſaith one) exceeds this Country in abundance of gold and ſilver, which is very fine: yet this is richer than <hi>Peru</hi> in fruits and Cattle, and exceeds it in Arts.

Their Kings ſucceeded not by right of bloud, but by electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: whom they held lawful to kill, if they were reputed cowards: for they uſed ſlings and arrows in their wars. They were ſeven Tribes in all, ruling in an <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> or Government of the Nobles and chief men, untill that the mightieſt Tribe choſe a King, to whom they all ſubmitted: of theſe Kings, we find ten mentioned, <hi>Vizilovitli</hi> being the firſt, <hi>Quabutimoc</hi> the laſt, yet they ſay <hi>Iz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coalt</hi> the 4th King brought the ſix Tribes under the <hi>Mexican</hi> Kings.

There is a place called <hi>Zimatatao,</hi> where, at the foot of a Mountain, are two fountains, one of black pitch, and the other of red, very hot; as alſo in the Iſle of <hi>Wolves</hi> near <hi>Lima</hi> is a fountain of Bitumen or ſlime like Pitch: and another at S. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len's</hi> point, (in which Province, although the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have a Fort at the Cape, yet the <hi>French</hi> have planted Colonies therein) wherewith they calk their ſhips exceeding well.

                     <p>The third Province of Northern <hi>America</hi> is <hi>Jucatan,</hi> lying op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Iſland of <hi>Cuba,</hi> called by the Inhabitants, <hi>Maiathan,</hi> or <hi>Maiapar:</hi> but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (<hi>Francis Hernandes de Cordova</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering it in 1517) named it <hi>Jucutan,</hi> that is, <hi>What ſay you;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when they asked the Countrie's name, the people not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding them, anſwered, <hi>Jucutan.</hi> It is a great Peninſula, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 900 miles about; and the more it advanceth into the Sea, the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:33388:404"/>more it enlargeth it ſelf with two Capes; the <hi>Red</hi> being toward the North, and <hi>Cotoque</hi> toward the South: it is alſo diſtinguiſhed into, 1. <hi>Jucatan,</hi> having two noted Cities; one whereof for its beauty and greatneſſe they call <hi>Caire.</hi> 2. <hi>Guatimala,</hi> lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Jucata</hi> and <hi>Nicaraqua;</hi> beſides whoſe Town ſo called, or of S. <hi>James,</hi> are three others, Colonies of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> the ayr of which Territory is ſweet and pleaſant, having Mountains and Valleys yielding ſtore of fruit: and whoſe Inhabitants (they ſay) have loſt 500000 of their friends by the <hi>Spaniard's</hi> cruel dealing. 3. <hi>Acaſamil,</hi> an Iſle oppoſite to <hi>Guatimala,</hi> whoſe chief Town is <hi>Santa Cruza,</hi> as the Iſland it ſelf is commonly called. There are many Deſarts in <hi>Jucatan,</hi> yet rich in many places in Corn, Fruits, Honey, Wax, Stags, Hares, Geeſe, and Poultry; it hath no rivers, yet remaining alway freſh, becauſe it being ſtony two or three foot under ground, little Springs and Brooks flow out. <hi>Guatimala</hi> (among other herbs and fruits) abounds in a Tree whoſe fruit is like an Almond, but not round, ſerving the <hi>Indians</hi> for meat, drink, and alſo for money; 20000 Cacaos being worth 120 Rialls or 3. l. in <hi>Guatimala,</hi> and 200 in <hi>Mexico.</hi> There is a Lake in this Country 100 miles long, and 20 broad, &amp;c. The Town through the hills or a Vulcanoe's caſting forth flames of fire, at whoſe foot it was built, which happened in 1540, Decemb. 20. it was tranſported two miles off; But in 1581, there was ſuch an irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fire about two miles from the Town, as if all would have been conſumed: and the next day, filling the Valley with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of aſhes, it almoſt buried the Town. And the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this Vulcanoe's fire running downwards 24 hours ſpace, like a furious torrent, burned rocks and ſtones, and ſo heating five ſtreams, that they were not paſſable: and ſome write they were dryed up. And while this was doing beneath, they heard fearful thunders, ſeeing flames and lightnings in the ayr, wonderfully terrifying them. The <hi>Jucatans</hi> are generous and warlique, living longer than them of <hi>New Spain.</hi> They ſeemed to be more civill than other <hi>Indians;</hi> for they did not eat their enemies taken in war, though they ſacrificed them: yea, they abhorred the <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> for the ſame: Alſo the <hi>Spaniards</hi> found a great Town here artificially built of Stone and Lime, with fair Market-places; they had alſo laws, traffiquing by exchange, without money. And as to Religion, they had fair Temples, many of whom uſed circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. In the much frequenting of whoſe Temples, and their great Idolatries, they are ſaid to have worſhipped the Croſſe to obtain rain. And ſome report, That they told the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> A beaurifull man had left with them Croſſes for a remembrance, which they found amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is <hi>Nicaraqua,</hi> lying next to <hi>Mexico</hi> or <hi>New Spain,</hi> toward the South-Eaſt; which hath many places well peopled, but they are ſmall. The two beſt Towns therein are eſteemed to be, <hi>Leon,</hi> where they have a Biſhop's See; and New <hi>Granado.</hi> They ſay, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> call this Province (for its pleaſantneſſe and fruitfulneſſe)

                        <hi>Mahomet's Paradiſe;</hi> yet is it ſandy, and ſo burnt with heat in Summer, that a man can ſcarce travel by day, but by night. There are in ſome places, Trees ſo big, that ſix men can ſcarce fathom them: and ſome trees are of ſo delicate a nature, that its branches wither as ſoon as they are toucht. It is as much annoyed with Parrots, as our Countrie is with Crowes and Rooks. About 35 miles from <hi>Leon,</hi> there is a Vulcano or fiery hill, whoſe flames may both be ſeen far in the night; and alſo that the hole from whence the fire proceeds, is 250 yards deep, as ſome have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Theſe <hi>Nicaraguans</hi> are more White than Olive of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and of a good ſtature: yet their Country which thus aboundeth in all things, is not great. Before the Spaniards made them outwardly Chriſtians, they had a good way of puniſhment for theft; the thief to be ſlave to the robbed till he had made ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. But for him that ſhould kill the Cacique or Prince, no puniſhment was by a law ordained; becauſe they ſaid, ſuch a thing could not happen: Even as <hi>Solon</hi> inſtituted no law for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of Parents; for they thought perſons were not ſo unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>

Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> diſcovering this Country in 1585, and the King thereof willingly ſubmitting himſelf to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, <hi>New Albion,</hi> a name of <hi>Great Brittain;</hi> and whoſe chief Town is ſo called. Some of theſe people are ſaid to be Canibals; yet hath <hi>Quivira</hi> a temperate ayr, and plenty of paſture: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have ſtore of Kine, which are their chiefeſt riches; whoſe Hides (they ſay) cover their houſes, their fleſh yields meat; their bones, bodkins; their ſinews, ropes; their maws, bladders; and horns, veſſels; their hair, thred; their dung, fire; their bloud, drink: and the skins of their Calves, budgets or buckets to draw and keep water. <hi>Vaſques</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> when he conquered this Country, ſeeing ſome ſhips on the farther Sea, well made, and laden, they conjectured there was traffique from <hi>Cathaia</hi> and <hi>China</hi> hither. And as for <hi>New Albion</hi> in particular, it is ſaid to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant both to eye and palate, as abounding in Fruits. There is reported alſo, to be a ſtrange kind of Hare, like a Cat in his tail, a Want in his feet, with a bag under his chin, wherein, after his belly is full, he keeps the reſt of his proviſion. Theſe Inhabitants are ſaid to be hoſpitable; yet worſhipping devils, and ſo given to Witchcraft.</p>

The Natives called this Country <hi>Apalchen;</hi> But the Engliſh diſcovering it through Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>'s char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and directions in 1584, in honour of the Maiden-Queen, <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> it was named <hi>Virginia.</hi> There are two Capes on both ſides of it, that of <hi>Charls</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> and as it were fortified; but one onely entrance into it by Sea, at the mouth of a goodly Bay, two rivers water it; and there are three chief Towns therein, one being <hi>James</hi>-Town. Our Engliſh went over divers times to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit it; ſome returning, as not liking the Country, not ſo much for its barrenneſſe, as for unſuitableneſſe of the Climate: There were a pretty number; then were they not a little diminiſhed, for the barbarous Natives ſlew 300 by treachery in 1622; but it hath been even yearly inhabited ſince that, by the Engliſh, and divers plantations made, and houſes built; ſo that they have a Government, yet acknowledging <hi>England</hi>'s Common-wealth as Supream; and is very eminent for the Trade of Tobacco there planted: yet the Country affords other things, as Pitch, Tar, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, Turpentine, Allom, ſtore of Cedar, Oyl, Grapes, plenty of ſweet Gums, Dies, Timber, Iron, and Copper-Mines: and for the land, (when tilled) it is ſaid, that two acres of ſome, hath brought forth 400 buſhels of Corn; they have alſo abundance of Maize, likewiſe Beaſts, Fowl, (whereof, as in <hi>Marie-land,</hi> joyning to <hi>Virginia,</hi> and planted alſo by Engliſh) their great and goodly Turkies have been commended) fiſh and fruit. The naturall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants have their cloathing in a mantle of Deer-skin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their privities, an apron of the ſame; and are reported uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to paint their bodies with pictures of Serpents, and ugly beaſts; worſhipping all things, eſpecially things able to do them hurt, as fire, water, thunder, &amp;c. <hi>New-England,</hi> which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the North part of <hi>Virginia,</hi> comes here to be mentioned, which in a ſhort time (in compariſon) (though not without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and dangers of Natives) grew up to a flouriſhing plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, being now full of good Towns; and for the fruits of the earth, is fitly called another <hi>England.

Thoſe who went hence, thither, at the firſt, were chiefly ſuch as (both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and people) could not conform to our Biſhop's ceremonies; but were zealous both in preaching and hearing. I take their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Government to be a Democracy, or men choſe out of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to govern. And as for their Church-Government, it is a kind of a mixt, between Presbytery and Independency: whether term of time hath not made them colder, and leſſe conſcientious and tender, than at the beginning, I much queſtion; by God's light and truth, (more clearly breaking forth in this his day) he comes to try the children of men; for beſides the oppoſition which ſome among themſelves have found, for differing in points of Religion from the generality, ſome that have lately in Gods fear, and from a good intent gone over to them, have found but coorſe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.

The people hereof are ſaid to be indifferently civill; yet painting their faces, both male and female, and dance much, ſometimes ſtark naked for agility ſake: alſo much affected to hunting: and whoſe Wives are loving and chaſte to their Husbands. The Ayr being alſo temperate, and the Countrie's ſoyl fruitful.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, <hi>New France,</hi> diſcovered by one <hi>Jaques Cartier,</hi> a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> in 1534; where, beſides the Native Inhabitants, ſome few <hi>French</hi> remain: for the Province is ſaid to be but barren, and the people baroarous Pagans; yet it hath three chief Towns; two whereof being ſcituate on two rivers, <hi>Canada</hi> and <hi>Sanguinai,</hi> are ſo called themſelves; and <hi>Hochelaga,</hi> of a round form, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with three Timber rampiers within each other, two rods high, and ſharp at top, having but one gate, ſhut up with barrs and piles, and containing but about 50 great houſes. Thoſe who dwell not in the Towns, live in Boats, and lying under them, I ſuppoſe, when they ſleep. They are alſo reported to have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of an earthly Paradiſe after death, thinking they ſhall firſt aſcend to the Stars, and thence be carried into green Fields, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Trees and Flowers, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, <hi>Terra,</hi> or the Land <hi>Corterialis,</hi> ſo called from a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall</hi> named <hi>Gaſper Corterialis,</hi> who firſt found it in 1500, it is alſo called <hi>Di Laborodora,</hi> and is bounded on the South with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned River <hi>Canada,</hi> and on the North with <hi>Eſtotiland.</hi> I find not any Towns this people have, but their principall Villages are three, <hi>Sunta Maria, Breſte,</hi> and <hi>Cabo Marzo. Canada</hi> is a great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver 900 miles long, 800 whereof are Navigable, and He hath his riſe out of the Hill <hi>Hombuedo,</hi> being alſo, at higheſt overflowing, ſaid to be 105 miles broad. Some call it <hi>Laurence</hi> his River, and likewiſe the River of the three Brothers. The Natives are ſaid to be brown, ſwift, good Archers, but barbarous, living in low Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and Caves, (yet they wear Braſſe, and Silver Bracelets, as Ornaments) neither ſeems the Country to be fertile, for that they feed generally on fiſh.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, And Laſtly, <hi>Eſtotiland,</hi> the moſt Northern tract of <hi>America</hi> as yet diſcovered, and called by us <hi>New-found-Land,</hi> on whoſe South-ſide, lyeth the Land <hi>Croterialis,</hi> and on a North part thereof, <hi>Davis</hi> his ſtraits, from one <hi>John Davis,</hi> who ſeeking to find a quicket paſſage (then before found) by the North of <hi>America,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cathaia,</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> performed it not with ſuch proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe as he began it. Yet two others, to wit, <hi>Cabot,</hi> and <hi>Frobiſher,</hi> were before him in that deſign, the one in 1497, the other in 1576, which laſt, making three Voyages, and bringing home a great deal of Ore, not worth his pains, and ſome of the Natives; he
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:33388:406"/>called a great Promontory of this Country, Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and the adjoyning Sea, <hi>Frobiſhers,</hi> Straits. But the ſhoar of this Region was (ſo far as I find) firſt deſcryed by two brothers, ſent by <hi>Zichmi</hi> a King of <hi>Friezland</hi> not far from <hi>Groenland;</hi> which lyeth on the other ſide of theſe Straits, in 1390. But there was ſince theſe, a re-diſcovery hereof, by ſome of our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in 1527, ſince which, it hath been much viſited for Fiſh, called New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found-land-Fiſh; wherewith the Seas thereof do ſo abound, that they will, in the Summer-Moneths of fiſhing for this is a cold Country) take two or three hundred of them in four hours time; whence in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhips (called Sacks) they are carried into other parts, eſpecially into <hi>Spain;</hi> though preſent War with that Nation, may hinder that Trade. I have heard ſome common Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men complain of the hardneſſe and barrenneſſe of this Voyage, as alſo the toilſomeneſſe thereof, and that if one fall ſick there, while they are at their work of fiſhing, he is little better reſpected then a Dog amongſt them, &amp;c. For the Merchant and Maſter, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the profit, the very common men are apt to be cruell to each other, as being earneſt to have their voyage made as much as they can. The Natives alſo fiſhing on the Ocean in ſmall Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Boats, carry home under their Arms what they have caught. This ſoil is ſaid to be naturally good enough; whoſe inhabitants ſome will have, more Witty, and alſo judicious then the other <hi>Americans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Southern <hi>Peninſula,</hi> called <hi>Peruana,</hi> extends from <hi>Nombrede Dios,</hi> and <hi>Panama,</hi> unto the Gulfs of <hi>Uraba</hi> and <hi>Michael; Nombre de Dios,</hi> ſtanding on the North Sea, and <hi>Panama</hi> on the South, which are the two chief Ports of <hi>Peruana,</hi> becauſe all traffique between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> muſt needs paſſe thereby; The ſtraight of Land, or <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> whereby it is tyed to <hi>Mexicana,</hi> is called that of <hi>Darien</hi> but 17 miles broad, and (as others) but twelve; wherefore ſome have moved to <hi>Spains</hi> Councell, that a Navigable Channell may be cut thorow it to ſhorten the common Voyages to <hi>China,</hi> and the <hi>Molucco</hi> Iſlands; but for ſome reaſons, it hath not yet been attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This part of <hi>America</hi> is 17000 miles in Circuit; contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five principall Provinces or Countries.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Caſtella Aurea,</hi> or <hi>Golden Caſtile,</hi> comprehending the North part of <hi>Peruana,</hi> with part of the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> and was ſo called from it's abundance of Gold. <hi>Nombre de dios,</hi> and <hi>Panama,</hi> but now mentioned, muſt have reference unto this Country, as alſo <hi>Uraba's</hi> and <hi>Michaells</hi> Gulfs: which are the extent thereof, and not of all <hi>Peruana.</hi> This is ſubdivided into four Provinces. 1. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtella Del Oro,</hi> ſeated in the very <hi>Iſthmus;</hi> whoſe two chief Cities built by one <hi>Didacus Niqueſa,</hi> are, <hi>Theonyma,</hi> according to the <hi>Greek</hi> language, or <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> (ſo named for that the ſaid <hi>Didacus</hi> having been divers times diſmally croſſed, bade his men go on ſhoar here, In the name of God, which thoſe words do ſignify) and is on the Eaſt; and <hi>Panama</hi> ſcituate on the Weſt. Secondly, <hi>Nova</hi> or new <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> bounded on the South with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:33388:406"/>
                        <hi>Peru,</hi> on the North with <hi>Caſtella del Oro;</hi> two of whoſe beſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are <hi>Santa Eſpritta,</hi> and Saint <hi>Margarets,</hi> once called <hi>Tocoia.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Nova,</hi> or new <hi>Granada,</hi> lying on the South of <hi>Cumana,</hi> or <hi>Cartagena:</hi> whoſe chief Towns are Saint <hi>Foye,</hi> where is a Court of Juſtice, and the ſeat of an Arch-biſhop; here are alſo <hi>Tungia, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Veluz, Merida,</hi> and Saint <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> &amp;c. here is a Sea-<hi>Cape,</hi> almoſt triangular; between whoſe Weſtern Angle called <hi>Arani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aes</hi> point on the Eaſtern, called <hi>Salines</hi> point, is the Angle named the Three-points. Fourthly, <hi>Cartagena,</hi> which hath five Cities therein. <hi>Cartagena,</hi> which the Natives called <hi>Calamur,</hi> which Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> ſeizing on, took vaſte ſums of Money, and 240 Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ordinance in 1585. Alſo <hi>Abvida,</hi> Saint <hi>Martha,</hi> on the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Abvida,</hi> having alſo other names; New <hi>Calet,</hi> and <hi>Venezuela,</hi> They call theſe three laſt mentioned countries; <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> or the firm land. Neither <hi>Panama,</hi> nor <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> have a good Ayre; but the latter is found the worſe of the two, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Sepulchre. Wherefore the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ordered (in 1584) <hi>Nombrede Dios,</hi> to be tranſported to a lower place, and to name it Saint <hi>Philip. Panama's</hi> Ayre is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe unwholeſome, and it's heat ſaid to be inſupportable: Yea, the whole Country of Golden <hi>Caſtile</hi> is but little inhabited; and that, both for the Ayre's badneſſe, proceeding from many dead waters (perhaps like ſome lakes, that are in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> the upper, of whom <hi>Ovid</hi> ſpeaketh; that whoſoever drinketh of their waters, either grows mad, or is poſſeſſed with a wonderfull heavy drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe) or for the bad ordering or government of the firſt diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who brought many to their ends, as in other places. And as for its fruitfullneſſe, Maize groweth abundantly, (although wheat doth not ripen there) they have alſo much Sea-fiſh, and fiſh of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; wherein are Crocodiles, ſome being twenty five foot long. It is obſerved, that our ſeeds and plants, become leſſe and worſe at <hi>Panama,</hi> and <hi>Nombre de dios,</hi> (Coleworts and Lettices being thrice ſown, becomming nought worth, as even changing their kind) whereas they become better in many parts of New <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru.</hi> New <hi>Granada</hi> is environed very ſtrongly with Rocky Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, yet is moſtly full of pleaſing Valleys which bear fruit. Near Tungia are Golden Mines, and Emeralds; and nigh the Cape of the three points, are found ſtore of Pearls, growing in the fiſh of Oyſters, and called Unions, becauſe two are ſeldome found alike, whoſe price is much fallen, through the great quantity ſent thence into <hi>Europe;</hi> and alſo of the Emeraulds, great ſtore of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn not onely here, but alſo at <hi>Portueil,</hi> and about <hi>Mante</hi> in <hi>Peru.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Guiana,</hi> or <hi>Guinee,</hi> ſcituated under the Aequinoctial line, or, as ſome have deſcribed it, to be five degrees from it, and that (as one ſuppoſeth) towards the South, it hath on the South and Eaſt the River <hi>Maragnon,</hi> (named alſo <hi>Amazone,</hi> from the <hi>Amazones</hi> fabulouſly reported to have lived here); and <hi>Orellana,</hi> from one ſo called, who firſt ſailed therein in 1543, it is ſaid to be
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:33388:407"/>towards the Sea 200 miles broad, and Navigable 6000 miles) on the Weſt, the Mountains of <hi>Peru,</hi> and on the North, the River <hi>Orenoque,</hi> alſo called <hi>Raliana,</hi> from Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> who in 1595, made a full ſurvey of this Country; Ships of Burthen will Sail here one thouſand miles, and Pinnaſes and Boats almoſt two thouſand. The chief Cities and Towns are <hi>Manao,</hi> called by the <hi>Spaniards Eldorada,</hi> that is, the guilded City, from the abundance of Gold that <hi>Deigo Ordas</hi> ſaw therein; this City is ſo large, that the ſaid <hi>Deigo</hi> is reported to have travelled from Noon that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred it, all that day, and the next day till night before he could come to the Kings Pallace; it is ſeated on a Salt Lake 600 miles long. <hi>Winicapora, Morequito,</hi> which is a ſafe Harbour, and Saint <hi>Thome,</hi> built with dirt and ſticks, and which occaſioned the undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh.</hi> The Natives uſe to dwell in Trees in Winter time for fear of inundations, on which they do Artificially make ranks of building; (they ſay alſo it is ſo in Golden <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and <hi>Braſile</hi>) for there is ſtore of River, and Freſh waters in every part thereof, ſo that this Country is reported to be exceeding fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and as green and pleaſant to the eye as any in the World. Experience hath and doth find it to be ſtored with Golden Mines. Whence not onely good Gold, but Elephants Teeth are brought. The People being it ſeems Black of Colour, whom <hi>ENGLISH</hi> Merchants buy, and ſell again as ſlaves to Work in other Plantations. The Voyage alſo hither being accounted ſickly.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Braſile,</hi> (ſo called, from a red wood abundantly there growing) was diſcovered accidentally, by <hi>Peter Alvares Cabral,</hi> in 1501, and hath on the Eaſt the <hi>Vergivian</hi> Sea, on the Weſt the <hi>Andes</hi> or Mountains of <hi>Peru,</hi> (which are unto <hi>Peruana,</hi> as <hi>Taurus</hi> is to <hi>Aſia</hi>) it begins at the river <hi>Maragnon,</hi> and extends to that of <hi>Plata</hi> or of ſilver. Among the chief places of <hi>Braſile</hi> are, <hi>Pariba,</hi> on this ſide of <hi>Auguſtine's</hi> Cape, called alſo, <hi>The City of Snow. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabuco,</hi> or <hi>Pernanambuck,</hi> a good Town; whence the Braſile wood uſed in <hi>Europe</hi> in dying cloathes, is with us called <hi>Fernanbuck.</hi> Here are alſo the Towns <hi>Aſtenſio,</hi> and <hi>Anna Equitum;</hi> and <hi>The Bay of all Saints;</hi> which Town is ſeated on a gulph 9 miles broad at the mouth, and 30 in compaſſe, where Whales do enter and ſport themſelves; where is alſo the Governour of the Province, and the Biſhop. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s <hi>Cape</hi> hath 8 degrees and a half of height of the South Pole, and is the neareſt to <hi>Africk</hi> of any in the New World, not being held above 1000 miles therefrom. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are moſt exceeding brutiſh and barbarous; the greateſt part living without law, learning, or religion, nor acknowledging any Prince: they alſo go generally naked. They are much given to Sooth ſaying, and are accounted very great Sorcerers: not loving labour; but affecting idleneſſe, ſports, feaſts, and dancing; yet they undertake not war to extend their bounds, but for honour, when they think themſelves wronged, and follow him therein, whom they hold the moſt valiant; and eating with ſolemn feaſts,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:33388:407"/>thoſe they take in war: They ſeem however, to have a pretty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, who blaming the <hi>Spaniard's</hi> covetouſneſſe in coming from the other World to dig for gold, held up a wedge of it, and cryed out, <hi>Behold the God of the Chriſtians.</hi> They ſound not L.F. nor R. in their language: one of them declaring the reaſon of that to be, becauſe they had neither Law, Faith, nor Rulers among them. The Ayr of this Country is delicate, and the Country it ſelf pleaſant, being full of Mountains, Rivers, and Forreſts, and is diſtinguiſhed into Plains and Hills alway green, with many plants and various creatures unknown to us of <hi>Europe:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their huge Braſile Trees, there is the Plant <hi>Copiba,</hi> whoſe bark being cut, ſends forth Balm; unto which remedy, the very beaſts when they are bitten with Serpents and other beaſts, (for the hills are high, craggy, and very barren, and full of ravenous beaſts, and poyſonſome Serpents) have recourſe; ſo that, many of theſe plants are almoſt without barque. The Cedar alſo is an ordinary tree there. The people feed on all kinds of beaſts, Apes, Lizards, Serpents, and Rats; and make their bread of the root of an nerb as big as Purſlain, by firſt preſſing out its deadly juice; then drying it in the Sun, and making meal thereof; alſo drink of the ſame meal, like unto Beer. But the greateſt riches drawn out of <hi>Braſile,</hi> are very fine Cotton, and excellent Sugars; unto which traffique, the <hi>Portugals</hi> are much given, having built di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places to boyl and refine their Sugar, and entertaining many ſlaves from <hi>Guinee</hi> and <hi>Congo.</hi> Wonderful rich Mines are alſo ſaid to be ſome of the finews of this Region.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Chile,</hi> (ſo called, of a principall Valley, and which word ſignifyeth nipping cold) hath for bounds on the North, <hi>Peru;</hi> on the South, the <hi>Magellane</hi> ſtraights. In the 30th degree, (for <hi>Chile</hi> extends unto the 27th from the height of 25 and an half, from the South toward the North) is the famous Valley of <hi>Arauco,</hi> whoſe Inhabitants furiouſly defended themſelves, and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their freedom many years. The Metropolitan Town is St. <hi>James,</hi> built on the river <hi>Parais,</hi> in the valley of <hi>Mapoco,</hi> built by the Spaniards; who have divers Colonies here: among which, that of the Imperial is one of the beſt, which before the war of the <hi>Arauques,</hi> had 300000 men of ſervice, as <hi>Valdivia</hi> had 100000. <hi>Arepiqna</hi> was one of their faireſt Towns, alſo, which (by a ſtrange earthquake in 1562, overthrowing Mountains, and ſtopping ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers paſſages) was much defaced, if not ruined; and was ſaid to ruine 300 leagues along the Sea coaſt; and renewing again in 1575, it overthrew the Town of <hi>Valdivia.</hi> This Countrey was diſcovered by one <hi>Almagrus,</hi> but ſubdued by <hi>Baldivia;</hi> whom the <hi>Chilois</hi> taking priſoner, they as enraged choaked him with melted gold. They are very warlique, and of a great ſtature, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay (as one) 11 foot high. This Province hath a river (and ſome ſay its rivers are ſuch) running violently by day; but in the night hath no water: for it is fed by ſnow melting from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which through night's coldneſſe, congealeth: for the Ayr's
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:33388:408"/>piercing cold (they ſay) hath cauſed ſome unſenſibly to loſe their members in the Deſarts, or elſe to fall down dead. <hi>Chile</hi> being without the burning Zone is like to <hi>European</hi> Countries, yielding ſtore of Corn, very good Wines, and all ſorts of Fruits that are to be ſeen in Spain. They have alſo good paſtures, many Oxen &amp; Sheep, and horſes: their Summer being our Winter: But the wars with them of <hi>Arauco</hi> (the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deadly enemies) hath made it not to be well peopled; whoſe Inhabitants that are, are attired in wild beaſt's and Seals skins, and armed with Bows and Arrows.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Peru</hi> is bounded on the South with <hi>Chile,</hi> and on the North with Golden <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and is divided into three parts, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Plains, and Andes: along the Sea it's plain and low, with many Valleys, and is 1500 miles long, and but 30 or 45 broad. Toward the Eaſt are the Andes or two chains of Mountains in view of each other, and are ſaid to run from the <hi>Magellan</hi> ſtrait, where they begin, between <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> and <hi>Panama,</hi> unto the firm land; called alſo <hi>Cordeliere:</hi> Weſtward is <hi>Sierra</hi> or the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, their breadth being not above 60 miles; ſo that <hi>Peru</hi> is not above 120 miles broad in all: and hath about 50 Valleys, the chief being <hi>Xauxa,</hi> (42 miles long, and 15 broad) with 3 others. This Country taketh its name from the river <hi>Peru,</hi> with which it is likewiſe bounded on the North ſide; but the principal Rivers are <hi>Maragnon Guaiachil,</hi> &amp; <hi>Rio di la Plate;</hi> which laſt is ſaid to be 2000 miles in length, and 150 broad at the mouth. All the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are diſtinguiſhed chiefly by three ſorts, whoſe languages are diſtinct: and every one contains many other people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, differing in names. They uſed to war againſt each other, till by the victory of <hi>Ginacave,</hi> (whom I take to be <hi>Guaima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capa,</hi> the 5th King of <hi>Peru,</hi> that we have knowledg of) the cauſe of that contention was taken away: eight Kings we find mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Ingoraia</hi> being the firſt, <hi>Amare</hi> the laſt; which election of a King among them is conjectured, by their own computation, to be in 1280, or ſomewhat thereabouts: and that, before, their Government was Ariſtocratical. <hi>Franciſco Pizarre</hi> ſeized on this Kingdom for the Spaniſh King, ſo ending the Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Guaſcar</hi> and <hi>Atabalipa, Guaimacapa</hi>'s ſons, who ſtrove for Empire, killing <hi>Guaſcar,</hi> and vanquiſhing <hi>Atabalipa</hi> nigh the City <hi>Caximaca:</hi> who after a vaſt ſlaughter of his men, continued a priſoner, &amp; treacherouſly ſlew him, after they had received from him a houſe full of pure gold and ſilver, worth about 10 millions, for the ranſom of his life; this was in 1533. <hi>Peru</hi>'s principal Towns or Cities are 8. <hi>Cuſco,</hi> being the ſeat of the Kings of the Nation; beautified (by their command) with Noblemens reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Palaces, and in which is a fair Market-place; in which, two high-wayes, ſtraight and levell, and croſſing the Country, being 2000 miles long, do thwart one another. Here is S. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaels,</hi> which was the firſt Colonie the <hi>Spaniards</hi> planted here: alſo <hi>Arequipa,</hi> which being ſcituated on the river <hi>Plata,</hi> is the Haven-Town to <hi>Cuſce:</hi> likewiſe <hi>Portoveio,</hi> where (if it may be
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:33388:408"/>credited) the grave-diggers light many times on mens teeth, which are three fingers broad: Then <hi>Lima,</hi> the ſeat of the Vice-Roy, and the See of an Archhiſhop: the Town is artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially built, neither is there ſcarce a private houſe whereinto water is not conveyed from the River. To ſpeak here of their manners, I ſhall forbear; onely this, when they conquered any Country, they allotted the firſt part to the ſervice of their gods, the ſecond to their King's revenues; and the third to the poors relief and maintenance: But as for the Countrie's quality, one thing is even to be admired, that in ſo ſmall a diſtance as in the breadth of <hi>Peru,</hi> it neither rains, ſnows, nor thunders in the plains: and on the <hi>Sierra,</hi> the ſeaſons have their courſe, as in <hi>Europe,</hi> and on the Andes it rains almoſt all the Winter. The tillage of the Valleys is but a league on either ſide diſtant from the rivers; and though it rain not on theſe plains in Winter; yet the Skie is full of thin miſts, whence falls a thin humour, which although it ſcarce wet the duſt, yet makes much for the bringing that to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which is ſowen: alſo nigh <hi>Lima</hi> theſe miſts do without other water, cauſe ſome places to flouriſh, and to be full of good paſtures. There are alſo ſome parts of the plains where no rivers being, abundance of Corn groweth, and all kinds of fruit; which muſt be either from moiſture from the Sea, or which rivers put forth, or from their being loſt in the ſand. <hi>Sierra</hi> abounds in Paſtures and Forreſts, where do feed a multitude of <hi>Vicagnes,</hi> like Goats, and <hi>Guanacos,</hi> and <hi>Pacos,</hi> which is a kind of <hi>Indian</hi> ſheep, who uſe to bear their burthens. The Andes have great ſtore of divers ſorts of Apes and Monkeys, alſo Parrots. But their herb <hi>Coca</hi> (much eſteemed) yields them yearly, at <hi>Potoſi,</hi> whither it is ſent, 500000 Crowns: in ſumme, the ſoyl, ſaith one, is luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in all manner of grain, whoſe Inhabitants are civill, their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties frequent, and their ayr wholſome: they have alſo great ſtore of Tobacco, which our <hi>Gerard</hi> the Herbaliſt calls (I take it) Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane of <hi>Peru:</hi> But as for gold and ſilver, it hath more than any Province in <hi>America:</hi> whoſe Mines (one ſaith) in ſome places yield more of theſe metals, than earth: and beſides other Merchandiſe, they do draw abundance of theſe metals; yet New Spain hath the other richer merchandizes. Yet <hi>Peru</hi>'s riches does commonly furniſh two third parts of all, which come from <hi>America:</hi> and among <hi>Peru</hi>'s treaſures, two are moſt eminent: the one is, the exceeding quantity of ſilver Mine of <hi>Potoſi:</hi> the other, the Mines of <hi>Guancavelque,</hi> where is found much Quick-ſilver; the one being diſcovered in 1545, the other in 1567.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CAPUT VICTORIAE,</hi> or the <hi>Cape of Victory,</hi> is accounted the very Pyris or Spear of the <hi>American</hi> Pyramis; and was ſo called, from the Ship called the <hi>Victory;</hi> in which, ſome of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellanus</hi> his Souldiers did paſſe, when they firſt compaſſed the World.

It is alſo obſervable, That <hi>Drake</hi>'s Navigation was finiſhed in two years and a halfs time, with great fortune, being begun in 1577. But to come to <hi>Magellanica;</hi> the ſecond general part of the New World: All that ſcituated to the South and Pole Antarctique is ſo called from theſe <hi>Magellan Straights,</hi> which by one, that ſaith he knew every Creek therein, are ſaid to be three. The firſt lying 14 leagues within S. <hi>Marie</hi>'s Cape, three leagues in length, ebb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both violently and ſwiftly; and whoſe firſt fall (for it is not fully half a mile broad) is very dangerous: then after, a Sea eight miles both in breadth and length, is the ſecond ſtrait, a dangerous and unpleaſing paſſage, three leagues long, a mile broad: which opening it ſelf into another Sea, reacheth even to the Cape of <hi>Victory.</hi> The third, properly called <hi>Magellan's Strait,</hi> enters, whoſe length is 40 leagues, two leagues broad in ſome, but in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not half a mile; which way ſoever a man turn, here, the wind will be ſurely againſt him; for on both ſides are high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains alway covered with ſnow; whence thoſe counter-winds, beating on all ſides, do iſſue forth. The waters courſe is here, likewiſe, full of turnings and changings: nor any anchorage to be expected, the channel being on the ſhoar ſide 200 fathom. But <hi>Magellanica</hi> is ſcituated beyond the 53d degree from the Aequinoctial; ſo that, that place of <hi>Magellanica</hi> unto which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellane</hi> pierced, doth agree to the Elevation of our Pole, ſaith <hi>Keckerman;</hi> for on the further ſide of the Straights to the South of <hi>Peru, Magellane</hi> found a huge land towards the South Pole, and touched on it again before he came to the <hi>Moluccoes:</hi> ſince whom, the <hi>Portugals</hi> trading towards <hi>Calecute</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> ſome of them have been driven by tempeſt ſo far, as to that now called the South Continent: divers alſo of ſundry Nations have upon occaſion touched on it: it is certainly diſcovered in ſome places to come up towards the North, to the Tropick of Capricorn: and is conjectured to go Southward as far as to the Pole: the reaſon is, becauſe none ever perceived the Sea to paſs thorow any part thereof: neither hath ſo much as any great River been deſcryed to come out of it into the Ocean: ſo that, if this be ſo, this lump of earth is as big as <hi>Aſia, Europe, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America</hi> put all together. There are yet reported very few memorable things hereof; ſome

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:33388:410"/>is ſeen above three hundred miles, whoſe abundance of Aſhes are ſaid ſometimes to cover the Country 200 miles about. Secondly, <hi>S.

The Country yields abundance of Rice, Maize, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers fruits and Cotton; but neither VVheat, nor VVine. They have alſo many beaſts different from ours, but Vipers, very great, long, and ſtrange of condition; and many Oſtriches. Their Lakes are full of Fiſh alſo; and at Saint <hi>Croix;</hi> (which is ſtrange) is a ſmall River, but two fadome broad, and very ſhallow, not running above a League (for it is ſuddenly loſt in the ſand) furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Town both with water, and all ſorts of good Fiſh, ſo that they can take them with their hands, or a pail; and it laſteth from February to May, but afterwards there is but little ſeen.

To ſpeak of all their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, would be here too tyreſome; onely I obſerve that the <hi>Varayes</hi> language extends it ſelf both to <hi>Braſile,</hi> and <hi>Paraguay</hi> unto the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayes,</hi> and their Neighbours Countrey.

Thoſe lying in the former Sea, are either the <hi>Inſulae Latronum,</hi> or the Iſlands of Robbers, and commonly called <hi>Latrones,</hi> they are two in number, a good diſtance from the <hi>Moluccoes;</hi> which name, <hi>Magellane,</hi> who diſcovered them, is ſaid to give them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Native Iſlanders ſtole away his Cockboat. But ſaith one, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had once found out an ordinary paſſage from the South Sea, towards the <hi>Moluccoes,</hi> they never ceaſed to travail that way, and diſcover more and more, whereby they found out divers Iſlands not formerly known; as two, a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the <hi>Moluccoes;</hi> which, becauſe they be inhabited by men who not onely ſteal from each other, but pilfer away all they can from ſtrangers landing thereabouts; they are called <hi>Inſulae Latronum,</hi> or the Iſlands of Robbers. Or the <hi>Inſulae Salomonis, Salomon's Iſles;</hi> which are nearer to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies:</hi> theſe are ſaid to be many in number, 18 whereof are worth the minding: and of thoſe, S. <hi>Thome,</hi> S. <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and <hi>Gaudalcanall</hi> are the three big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt. <hi>Lope Garcia</hi> diſcovered theſe in 1567, and miſtaking them for the the Land of <hi>Ophir,</hi> whither <hi>Solomon</hi> ſent for gold, he ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them: yet (it ſeems) he found ſtore of gold to be in them, or elſe he could not have had a pretence for the ſame. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are ſaid to go naked, and to be yellowiſh in colour. Some other Iſlands alſo, <hi>Magellane</hi> himſelf deſcryed: at which, he land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as thinking to furniſh himſelf with Victuals and freſh water, in his paſſage to the <hi>Moluccoes,</hi> found the places wholly barren and uninhabited; wherefore he called the <hi>Inſula's, Infortunatas,</hi> or Unhappy Iſlands, as being contrary in quality to the Canaries, which are termed, The Fortunate or Happy Iſlands. Thoſe in the <hi>Vergivian</hi> Sea, which is ſo called, <hi>à Vergendo,</hi> from bending, are
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:33388:411"/>reckoned 9 in number: as, 1. <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> called by the Natives <hi>Haitie</hi> and <hi>Quiſquaia;</hi> and by the <hi>Spaniards, Hiſpaniola,</hi> and S. <hi>Dominico,</hi> from the chief Town they have built there. It was (as aforeſaid) the firſt place of the New World that was deſcry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is 500 miles long; the breadth being divers, in the largeſt place, about 300 miles. Here at <hi>Dominico,</hi> is a Preſident, an Archbiſhop, and a Court and Seat of Juſtice, with 5 Monaſteries. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are ſaid to have murdered 3 millions of her Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. There are other Towns, as S. <hi>John, Port-Royal, Port of Plata, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vana, Xaragua,</hi> with ſome others which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> builded not. The late Voyage and deſign of our Engliſh thither, is too too freſh in memory amongſt us, by reaſon of the bad ſucceſſe, and repulſe there received. The ayr of this Iſland is ſaid to be temperate; for, all plants brought out of <hi>Spain,</hi> do wonderfully grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe there; but Wheat comes better in hilly places: and they report, that roots as well as herbs will ripen and be fit to eat in 16 dayes. It hath many Havens, and Rivers, eſpecially 4 great rivers coming from the tops of Mountains, which being about the midſt of the Iſland, they run ſeverall wayes. They draw abundance of ſalt out of the Mountains like Cryſtal. In the midſt of the great Lake <hi>Haquey Gabon,</hi> whoſe water is ſalt, is the Iſland <hi>Guarizanta,</hi> very fit for fiſhing. The Iſland alſo yields gold, and in the <hi>Cabanien</hi> Mountains are ſaid to be Mines exceeding full: There is likewiſe great abundance of Sugar, Caſſia, Ginger, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick the wood Aloes, and Cinamon; alſo they have Azure. Now alſo they have ſo many tame beaſts, that they tranſport a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Hides from thence into Spain; whereas before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thither, there was but three kinds of four-footed beaſts. The Natives go naked, are ſloathfull, living one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their fiſhing: But the Inhabitants have now great traffique, growing rich, ſince Sugar-canes have been brought thither, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have made Mills and ſhops. 2. <hi>Cuba,</hi> called alſo <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> which lyeth on the Weſt of <hi>Hiſpaniola:</hi> it is 300 leagues long from Eaſt to Weſt, and 65 broad, but in many places not 20. Here are ſix Towns, the principal being that of <hi>S. James,</hi> where a Biſhop reſides: alſo there is <hi>Havana,</hi> moſt frequented of all the Iſland, it being a ſafe rode for ſhipping, and the Staple Town for Merchandiſe; the other are held not to be very well peopled; But at <hi>Havana</hi> rideth the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Fleet, till the ſeaſon and the wind do joyn to wafte them homeward. <hi>S. James</hi> or <hi>Jago,</hi> was ſo named of <hi>James de Valaſco</hi> who built it; both theſe Towns being alſo ſeated on the Northern ſhoar of the Iſland. There are many dangerous ſhelves about it: it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hilly and full of Forreſts and Rivers, having many Lakes both freſh and ſalt. The Natives, before it was diſcovered, lived all in common, as content with what nature brought forth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting alſo to tame Serpents, (of which there are many here) and went naked as them in <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi> The ayr here is ſaid to be temperate: having fine braſſe and Mines of gold in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:33388:411"/>and the gravel of rivers almoſt all gold, which is yet ſaid to be ſomewhat droſſie. It is reported to abound with Ginger, Caſſia, Maſtick, the wood Aloes, Cinamon, and Sugar; 15 miles from Saint <hi>James</hi> Town, is a Valley covered naturally with great bowls of ſtone, which ſeem as if ſet for pleaſure; and nigh the Princes Port, is a Spring caſting forth Pitch continually.

The latter the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are ſole Maſters of, which was taken from the <hi>Spaniard</hi> within this thirty years, and through induſtry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (according to the bigneſſe of the place) an eminent Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for Cotton and Brown Sugar: they have alſo Tobacco, but it is of the worſt ſort, wherefore they ſcarce now plant it; alſo Ginger in good quantity. The chief Town is called <hi>Indian</hi>-bridge, whither Veſſels for traffique and otherwiſe do come; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are ſhops and handicrafts men, but their houſes are built low, by reaſon of winds called <hi>Hirricanes;</hi> amongſt other food, they have much of the fiſh called Tortle; which is a good meat, and being dreſſed, eats like Veal.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> have a convincement (though barbarous) of a God, lifting up their eyes to Heaven in adverſity, &amp;c. But their fooliſh minds being darkned, they had many fooliſh cuſtomes towards the deceaſed; for thoſe of <hi>Peru,</hi> and the neighbour Countries, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that men uſe to eat, drink, and wantonize with women after buriall, did commonly either kill, or bury quick ſome of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, his beſt beloved wife and ſervants, to wait on him in the other world: they alſo under the figure of Idols of ſtone, and wood of terrible ſhapes, worſhipped Devills for fear of harm they did, or might do them. The Devill being ſaid to ſpeak in divers of theſe Images, and give anſwer to their Prieſts. But the <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> (beſides their Images) would ſometimes worſhip living Idols; as a Priſoner, whom they attiring, and trimming like an Idol,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:33388:412"/>would ſacrifice, &amp;c. unto him: at length, when the Comedy was ended, and he grown fat in a Cage, they ſlaying him for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, made a Feaſt among themſelves. They of <hi>Peru</hi> had ſome Guacoes or Temples common to the whole Realm, and others private to every Province; But the <hi>Mexicans</hi> exceeded them of <hi>Peru</hi> much in greatneſſe of Temples and ceremonies: whoſe Prieſts were divided into the little, greater, greateſt of all, which were called Popes: they ſacrificed in their Temples, every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his degree; whoſe continual exerciſe was to caſt incenſe on their Idols; at Sun-riſing, or Sun-ſetting, at noon, or at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. And beſides Prieſts, there were Monaſteries of women: in <hi>Peru</hi> one in every Province, in which were two ſorts of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſome young Virgins, others called <hi>Mamacones,</hi> of ripe age, who commanded and inſtructed the others. The <hi>Mexicans</hi> had alſo a ſort of religious, called the daughters of Pennance, not above 13 years of age, and whoſe profeſſion laſted but a year: who were ſhut up in chaſtity, ſwept the Temple, prepared meat ſet before the Idol, which his Miniſters did eat. The <hi>Peruans</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed whatſoever they had good or goodly to their gods: But the <hi>Mexicans</hi> did not ſacrifice any men-children or Virgins, but what they took in war: wherefore, that they might have a great number, they ſubdued the Town <hi>Tlaſcala,</hi> moſt paganly intreating them. Thoſe of <hi>Cuſco</hi> counterfeited Supper, as a Sacrament of confederation and union with the Sun, and the Ingua or Prince. The <hi>Mexicans</hi> (moſt remarkably) made an Idol of roaſted Maize and Blite ſeed, mixt with honey, which they carried in proceſſion with merry ceremonies; then ſtripping the Idol, diſtributed pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the paſte to the people, who received them with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, ſaying, They did eat the fleſh and bones of their god. They in <hi>Peru</hi> counterfeited confeſſion, having Prieſts to hear it, holding it alſo a great offence to conceal any ſin in confeſſion; they went to it in adverſity, and when the Ingua was ſick: But the Ingua confeſſed not his ſins to a Prieſt, but to the Sun, that he might tell them to <hi>Vira coca;</hi> then entring into a running brook, he ſaid, <hi>I have confeſsed my ſins unto the Sun; thou river carry them into the Sea, where they may remain for ever drowned.</hi> They worſhipped alſo three Images of the Sun: naming one the Father, another the Son, the third, the Brother: and of their god of thunder, named <hi>Chuchille,</hi> they had three Statues, unto whom they attributed the ſame names. Likewiſe as to marriage, thoſe of S. <hi>Croix</hi> of the Mount, hinder marriages in ſome cauſes, and diſſolve that which is contracted; and in ſome cauſes, the joyned, cannot be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though it be unlawfull. But as for the Government of the New World; ſince the <hi>Spaniard's</hi> maſterdome: there are in all two Vice-royes; the one at <hi>Mexico</hi> in <hi>New Spain;</hi> the other of <hi>Peru,</hi> reſiding at <hi>Lima:</hi> this laſt having the greateſt authority. There are likewiſe 5 Soveraign Courts both in New Spain, and <hi>Peru,</hi> at 5 ſeverall Towns, unto which both <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:33388:413"/>have equall recourſe, and from which none may appeal. Here are likewiſe four Archbiſhopricks: one at St. <hi>Dominico,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other at <hi>Mexico,</hi> a third at <hi>Lima,</hi> the fourth at <hi>S. Foy</hi> in the New Realm: the firſt having three Biſhops under him; the ſecond, 10; the third, 9; the fourth alſo 3. Five ſorts of Popiſh Orders they have alſo in the New World, of <hi>Francis, Dominick, Auguſtine, De la Merced,</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> There are moreover two Inquiſitions; the one at <hi>Lima,</hi> the other at <hi>Mexico.</hi> Alſo two Univerſities in the ſame Towns. And it is alſo obſerved, that the <hi>Indians</hi> are not admitted to their communion, but after long proof; and with more difficulty at <hi>Peru,</hi> than at <hi>Mexico:</hi> neither do they ſuffer them commonly to ſtudy either Divinity or Philoſophy: and ſeldom admitting them to any Orders, becauſe of their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to drunkenneſſe.</p>
